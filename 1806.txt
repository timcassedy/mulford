At evening I had a long conversation with Levi, respecting his remaining with Mr. Wood.  He expressed a satisfaction to stay.  Came to Mr. Meeker's about 9.12 M.] After breakfast I went to town, carried to Mrs. Morrison some linen to make, - bou't. a pair of wax calfskin shoes of Walker for 14/ - call'd on Mr. Whelpley and dined with him,- spent the most of the afternoon with him.  Went to Maj. Kinney's where there was a company of Ladies,- return'd with Miss E. Russel & lodged with Charles.13 T.] Breakfasted at Mrs. Russell's.  Spent the most of the forenoon with Mr. Whelpley.  Came to Mr. Meeker's to dinner.  Spent the afternoon in conversation and reading.  At 5 o'clock, set out for Turkey in Mr. Meeker's chair, with Charles and Harry.  We arrived at the Doctor's little after sunset, Charles went with me to J. Crane's.  I sat up till 12 and after, talking with John & Betsey on Methodism.  Betsey has been a Methodist 18 months and John, about 3, tho' I have not long known it.  I find them strong in the faith, firm believers in immediate inspiration, divine impressions, attendant spirits &c,&c.14 W.] Rose late.  After breakfast I went down Turkey to D. Val. he had not ret'd. from a Camp Meeting held at or near New Rochelle in N.Y.  Saw Philemon Elmer who is this night to be married to Miss Nancy Potter, one of my old Dulcineas.  In the afternoon, ret'd. to Dr. Elmer's where I stay'd till 5,- then returned to J. Crane's.  In the evening I read a book, much esteem'd among the Methodists, entitled Lorenzo's chain, written by John Dow an enthusiast, best known by the title Crazy Dow.  This book is a recitation of Dow's experience and in it the author takes occasion to battle the Calvanistic Doctrines.  He appears to have some little knowledge of syllogistic reasoning, and has pick'd up several philosophical terms; but his book is very incorrect because he uses words very loosly and often assumes wrong premises, v.g. he calls the Creation a miracle,- says there are but six ways of receiving ideas, viz, by inspiration, and by the five senses.15 T.] After breakfast went to Uncle Cornelius' where I took dinner.  Call'd at Mr. Littell's & Mr. Jones',- talk'd a long time with Mr. Jones & Caty,- heard that Miss P. Baker another of my Dulcineas is soon to marry D. Walker.  Saw Mrs. R. my old Doxy.  Took tea at Mr. Schureman's and return'd to John's about sunset.  David Valentine soon came in to see me, after him came 6 other Methodists, and completely surrounded me.  Four of them soon return'd home, but the 3 remaining, staid till 10 when they made each in immediate succession, a most ardent prayer.  2 left us but David staid conversing with me till 1/2 past 12.16 F.] Rose late.  After breakfast went over to Mr. Schureman's to know what I might depend on about money.  About 10 or a little after I set out on foot for Morristown.  Dined at D. Elmer's. rec'd. of him one of my Schureman Bonds, which he has kept since last spring.  At 3 set out again & reach'd Mr. Meeker's before night.  Spent the evening in confab.17 S.] Before breakfast looked over some papers&c.  Going to Mr. Canf.d's was invited by C. Russel to go with him to a jury trial at Jus. Peer's in Rockaway.  I went with him in his chair, was gone all day, had a view of Rockaway valley and the circumjacent Mountains, came to Mr. Meeker's at night.18 Sunday] Spent the day at Mr. Meeker's with Mr. Wood.  Eve'g. went and slept with Levi.19 M.] Rose early and went to Mr. Meeker's.  After breakfast came to town to go with C. Russell to a trial at Sq. D. Camp's, Longwood.  We hired a couple of horses of a Yankee at J. Halsey's, and set out about 10.  Went to Dover where we dined.  At half past 1 we went on to J. Lacey's at lower Longwood; there we stopp'd a few minutes, then proceeded to Sq. D. Camp's, about 17 miles from Morris.  The trial was adjourn'd - we found thre Mr. J. Odel Ford, who lives 9 miles northeast, we went home with him where we arrived 1/4 past 8 - 25 miles from home.  With him we took lodging.	Mr. Ford owns a saw mill, a grist mill & two forges.  His situation is the roughest I ever saw.  He lives in a notch of the mountain, through which runs a branch of the Pompton river.  On the top of a fall, in this stream, of about 25 feet, he has placed his dam, which is easily made; and at the foot of the fall stands his works, except one forge which is about a mile up the stream.  His dwelling house is near his works, and it is with difficulty he can find earth enough for a moderate country garden.  The surface is almost completely made up of rocks.  Besides his works, he has a farm, lying at the distance of 1/2 mile, Northward, said to be the best in that part of the country.20 T.] Rose early and took a look at Mr. Ford's place & works.  We breakfasted at 8 & soon set out with an intention to go to Ramapo, i.e. to Pierson's nail factory in N.Y. state, on the Ramapo river.  After leaving Newfoundland, which is a considerable tract of land, we went by the way of Long-pond & Ringwood.  The roads were very rough and bad, we travelled, the most of the forenoon, through Shruboak barrens; the rest of the way, besides the shruboak land, was for the most part through woods, where we were continually infested by caterpillars, which hung down on their webs from the boughs of trees that shaded the road.  We passed Ringwood works about 2 in the afternoon.  Ringwood is a very pleasant valley, intersected in a handsome manner by a large branch of the Pompton River, and surrounded by mountains.  The Buildings, if I recollect are these: Two dwelling houses with requisite barns & outhouses, a Forge, a Furnace & two coal houses.  These works are now wholly out of repair & have not gone for a number of years.  Formerly a Mr. Old carried them on, he had but just put them in repair and started them when he broke.  They have since been sold to a company in Philadelphia, who hold them so high that nobody can afford to purchase and start them.  There is sufficient wood on the premises to supply coal for a great many years, the present owners are about selling, when they will probably be again started.	We arrived at Ramapo, 7 miles East of Ringwood about 5 in thea fternoon where we found the family of Mr. Jeremiah Pierson at home, and Mr. Isaac Pierson of N.Y., Jeremiah's brother and partner in the works.  Staid all night.21 W.] After breakfast we took a view of the works.  The buildings which the proprietors have erected within a few years and which are now standing are, a handsome two-story dwelling house, a store, a saw mill, a grist mill, a forge, a slitting mill, a sail shop, a blacksmith shop, a cooper's shop, a large barn and about a dozen comfortable dwelling houses for his workmen.  The men employed by them are about as follows: 3 clerks, 1 cooper, together with carpenters, farmers and carters, making the whole number of men in their constant employ about 120.  Their buildings and apparatus for work, aside from any stock, have already cost them about 60,000 Dollars, and they are constantly adding.  Their hands are able to make a ton and an half of nails in a day.  This is said to be the largest factory of any kind in the U. States.	Ramapo is three miles from the Jersey line, and 31 from N.Y. City.  After dinner we thought of coming to Patterson, but found our horses too stiff from yesterday's ride over the stones, we therefore concluded to stay till morning.  Spent the afternoon in playing checkers & backgammon.  Evening was employed in anecdotes, and an enquiry whether the sun is itself hot, or only draws heat from the earth.22 T.] At 8 we set out, with Mr. J. Pierson who was going to the city, and came home by way of Pompton and Parsippany.  Arrived at Morris about 5 in the afternoon.  I came to Mr. Meeker's at 9 with Mr. Wood.23 F.] Forenoon went to town and did not much of any thing.  Call'd on Mr. Whelpley & several others.  Staid at night with Chas. Russel.24 S.] A stormy day.  Spent the most of it at Mr. Canf.d's reading Robinson's Illuminin.  Came to Mr. Meeker's at night.25 Sunday] Attended meeting.  Heard Mr. Richards.  After meeting dined at Mr. Canfield's and came home to Mr. Meeker's with Mr. Wood about 4.  C. R. came with us and took tea.26 M.] Rose at 5 - breakfasted soon and went to town with Mr. Wood.  He set out for N.Y. and at 6 I set out on his horse fur Turkey.  Reach'd Turkey by 9 o'clock call'd at Mr. Littell's & Mr. Schureman's before dinner.  Aftn. went with Betsey to L. Willcocks'.  Eve'g. rec'd. of Mr. Schureman on his bond 78 Dollars.  Staid all night at John's.27 T.] After breakfast set out for Morristown - came by Muchmore's where I call'd an hour or so,- reach'd town before noon.  After dinner took a ride with Mr. Whelpley and conversed with him about coming to assist him in the Academy, after I graduate.  Settled with H. P. Russell.  Got my shirts of Mrs. Morrison & my shoes of Walker.  Lodged with Levi.28 W.] At 1/2 past 5 set out for New York in Col. Ogden's stage,- reach'd the Point 1/2 past 8 and N.Y. 1/2 past 11.  Dined at Mr. Lovell's; call'd on Mr. Wood at Baker's.  Evening call'd on Robt. Russell and went with him to J. Pierson's.  Lodged at Mr. Lovell's with Apollos.29 T.] Rose 7 o'clock.  Saw Mr. Hughes who told me that Professor Silliman had lately arrived form Europe and was going this evening to New Haven.  Call'd on Mrs. Dodge, Mrs. Akerley, and D. Saml. Akerley at the Hospital.  Dined with Mr. J. Pierson in Pearl street.  At 4 came to Mr. Lovell's and from there on board the packet at 5 for N.H.  We shoved out about 1/2 past 5 and rowed up to Hellgate which we reached about sunset.  We could not reach good anchoring ground above the gate before the tide turn'd,- we were consequently driven back to Harlem creek where we anchored and remain'd all night.30 F.] During the night a breeze sprang up at the N.E. which dragg'd our anchor and drove us aground.  We lay till 8 before we floated; when we took the tide and reagain pass'd the Gate, leaving one ship and 15 sloops all stemming the current with a good breeze at N.E. but without making any perceptible headway.  The wind was plump ahead; we had to beat, and that with little advantage.  About 10 we met Capt. Beacher, last night from N. Haven.  The wind continued all day fix'd ahead and strong, we kept beating, stretching into the Lee-bays in the afternoon to escape the head tide.  We reach'd Baton's Neck lighthouse about sunset, when the wind veered a point or two Southwardly and we thot. to lay into N.H.  From sunset we stood on the starboard tack till I retir'd about 9.31 S.] Rose about 5, when the captain told me the wind had veer'd back to N.E. and had obliged him to beat again.  It was now raining and the air was very thick.  The Capt. was on his watch and one man was heaving the Lead, in about 5 fathom water.  We soon found only 4-1/2 fathom water and the Capt. discover'd land not a 1/4 of a mile distant.  Not a soul on board knew what land it was and we were obliged to lay and wait a clearer sky.  In about 1/2 an hour the rain slackened and the air grew clearer, when the Capt. found the land in sight was the point at the W. side of N. H. harbour.  We then got under way again and in two or three tacks were enabled to stand up the Harbour.  We reach'd the wharf about 9.  Our passage on the whole was tedious tho' not rough:- only one out of about 20 passengers was sick.	Arrived at College a little before ten, regulated things in my room, and at 1/2 past 12 went to Mr. Perrit's to dinner where I intend to board during the summer.  Spent the afternoon principally in settling accts.  Paid N. Beers, J. Beers & Co. Twining and Fenn Sherman- took receipts.1806 June1 Sunday] Tired and had the tooth ache all day - did not go to meeting in Chapel.  Finished reading Jeremiah, and read about 1/2 of Watson's apology for the Bible, addressed to Thomas Paine.  The style of this work has logic and point.2 M.] In the morning paid Mead my washing bill.  Attended two recitations in Paley.  Aftn. agreed to hear Boyle recited some of his mathematical studies, and looked over Algebra in Webber to Division.3 T.] At 11 recited Paley.  Aftn. heard Boyle in Algebra and studied a lesson in Philosophy as well as a morning lesson in Paley.4 W.] Recited two lesson in P. and heard Boyle in Al. to scolium in Division.  Aftn. heard him in Philos. through the Laws of Motion, and studied some lessons for to-morrow.  Read the two last Heralds - call'd on Miss Ashmond.5 T.] Recited in the class, and heard Boyle's two lessons.  Wm. W. returned.6 F.] Recited in the class, and heard B. through Fractions in Algebra, to Falling bodies in Philos.  Our Philos. lecture was on the Air pump.7 S.] Heard Boyle at 9 on Involution and Evolution in Algebra.  At 11 recited in Catechism.  At 4 in aftn. heard Boyle in Enf. on Bodies falling down inclin'd planes.  Studied Phil. recitation for Monday morning.8 Sunday] Forenoon attended an ordination at the Church.  Aft. attended Chapel.  Ev'g. went to Mr. Hughes'.  After 9 learnt the reduction of SURDS.9 M.] Forenoon at 8 & 11 attended the dispute of the 1st division of the Class.  Aftn. & evg. read a few pages in Stuart's View of Europn. Society.10 T.] Heard Boyle.  Recited as usual in Paley.  Ev'g. studied the Pendulum in Enf.11 W.] Heard Boyle - heard the dispute in the class.  Ev'g. attended Lin. Society.12 T.] Heard Boyle through the two first Lemmas in the Cycloid, and to simple Equations.  Recited in Paley.  Studied Enf. and Algebra.13 F.] Heard Boyle recite.  Recited in Paley,- heard a lecture, from Nu Vey on Electricity.14 S.] At 8 in the morning Mr. Silliman lately ret'd. from England, began to proceed in the course of Lectures which he left unfinished when he went away.  He began with Oxygen.  Spent the most of the day studying Enf. & Algebra - went to Quadratic equations.15 Sunday] Attended meeting at the Chapel.  Read 24 chapters in the prophecy of Ezekiel.  In the afternoon Dr. Green of Phila. preached  his subject was on the 'State and exercises of the future Blessed'.  His sermon I suspect would read well; his manner is so theatrical he appears affected.  Did little in the evening.16 M.] Rose before 5 and after prayers walked till breakfast.  At 8 attended the dispute in the class till 9.  All College began now to be busy in preparing to observe the long wished for sight, the Great solar Eclipse.  Every boy knee high had his bit of smoked glass, and after 1/2 past 9, the College yard was pretty well fill'd with young "sun-gazers".  About 10 I went into a neighboring room and through a piece of glass, saw that the Eclipse was fairly begun.  I soon went into the garden of Professor Day, where I found him, Mr. Kingsley and several others, with the necessary apparatus fitted up for making correct observations.  The morning was extremely fine.  Not a cloud to be seen, very little wind stirring, and the air not uncomfortably warm.  Here I found two reflecting telescopes, and one, refracting, about 5 feet long.  Through the latter I look'd at the sun about 1/4 past 10.  It was now about 1 digit obscured on the W.N.W. limb, by a shadow, evidently of larger circumference than the sun.  Through the telescope the light part look'd red and not at all dazzling, the boundary between that and the dark part was perfectly defined, making two corners or horns as completely pointed as a mathematician could draw them on paper.  The moon was not discoverable, except as it darken'd the sun, of course the sun's dark part appear'd the same as the circumajacent sky.  Soon after I look'd through the large reflecting telescope, which magnifies the sun to the appearance of 5 or 6 feet in diameter.  The field of view in this instrument is so small that I could not see all the sun at once, but I could first look at one corner and by the rectifying machinery, turn the telescope so as to look along the edge of the light part to the other.  The boundary line appear'd here also, perfectly defined save now & then a small notch.  About 1/2 past 10 it was evidence there was a diminution of light,- it grew darker and darker,- about 10 minutes before 11 Madam Venus shewed her face, about 20 degrees west of the sun.  From 10 till 20 minutes past 11 the face of Nature look'd "awfully grand".  The sun now under its greatest obscurity discovered only a small luminous strip, about [illegible] of the Sun's diameter in breadth, and about 1/4 of his circumference in length.  Venus (I saw no other stars, tho' some say more were seen) appear'd as large as a star of the 3rd magnitude in a clear starlight night.  A sullen gloom was spread over the sky, not like the darkness of twilight, but more of the shade of the blackest thunder cloud.  A light streak, somewhat similar to the approach of light before sunrise, streach'd around the horizon, save about 40 degrees, in the North.  There the gloom extended from the Zenith quite to the tops of the hills, and even increas'd in blackness as it approach'd the horizon.  This portion of thick darkness, in which was contained the Moon's perfect shadow, could be observed majestically to shift its position in perceptible degrees, it being not more than 15 minutes from the time it became manifest in the N.W. before it lost its distinctness to the N.E., in the sun's increasing lustre.  The luminous strip on the sun's south limb, now began to stretch up on the west side, and the ends, which in the greatest obscurity appear'd considerably blunt in spite of the magnifying power of our best reflecting telescope, began to be better defined: the light began to return with apparently more rapidity than it departed, and the luminous part of the Sun was soon increas'd from the apparent breadth of 1/4 of an inch to that of an inch.  During the greatest obscurity, a diminution of heat as well as of light was manifest.  The air felt more damp and chilly than in similar weather it usually does 1/2 an hour after sunset.  Probably it was not actually colder, but was more manifest on account of the sudden transition.	At half past 11 the light was apparently almost restored, and I took no farther notice of it.	The result of Mr. Day's observations is as follows, after adjusting the time piece he used, by observations at 12 o'clock.  Beginning of the ECLIPSE 9 55' 45" A.M.  Middle 11 17' 45".  End 0 42' 30" P.M.  Greatest obscurity 256/257 of the Sun's diam. leaving 1/257 unobscur'd.	At Lenox, last fall, I made a calculation of this eclipse for this place, and my result was as follows: Begin'g. 9 56'. Middle 11 22'.  End 49' past 12.  The greatest difference was in the obscuration.  I made it total, and the total darkness to continue 1-1/2 minutes.17 T.	} Quit hearing Boyle recite, on account of its causing me more study than I can bear.  Recited my lessons in class, and heard the lectures from Prof. Day & Silliman.  Wrote a letter to D. K. Estey at Woodbury (Gloucester).  Read Shakespeare's "Merry Wives of Windsor" & "Midsummer Night's dream".  Thursday, began to go to Dancing school.  Wrote a letter to Levi.  Read the reign of Chas. I in Maver, and the period of the Commonwealth.18 W.	}19 T.	}20 F.	}21 S.	}22 Sunday] In the forenoon heard Dr. Green preach again in the Chapel, in the aftn. a Mr. Armstrong.  At prayers I read the sermon.  Read to day, from the 25 Chap. of Ezekiel to the end of Daniel.  Spent the eve'g. with Miss Brown &c.23 M.] Formed the scheme of my dispute, to be read next Monday, on the policy of England making peace with France.24 T.] Wrote on my dispute.  Rec'd. a letter from Cox at Danbury, stating that he is in a course of Salivation.  Spent the evening at Mix's garden & Wax room, bill 1.12   Rustious estimabar, gratis oculorum.25 W.] Wrote to Cox.  Read in Smith's wealth of Nations the principles of the British funding system, and a his'y. of the Brit. national debt.  Wrote some - attended Lin. Society at night.26 T.] Finished a rough draft of my dispute.  Recited in Paley and heard a chemical Lecture.27 F.] Heard a Lecture on Electricity, recited in Paley, & spent the aftn. in covers.28 S.] Heard a Lecture in chemistry on Phosphoric & Boracic acids.  recited in Catechism.  Began to copy my dispute.  Drink'd some wine with Whelpley.29 Sunday] Read in the Bible from Daniel to Naham.  Spent the evening in part at the old castle, commanded by the crooked nomed Col.    wrote a little.30 M.] Finished my dispute.  Read it at 8 in the class.  Read on a little in Maver's history of England.  Eve'g. waited on Misses Brown & Ives to Ruggles' exhibition at Bloomfield's assembly room.1806 July1 T.] Heard a chemical Lecture, and recited as usual.  Eve'g. went again to Ruggles' exhibition with Bacon, and after that was ended, I stay'd with a number of lads & lasses, and danc'd till 12.2 W.] Attended the dispute in the class.  At 9 went to my dancing lesson.  Did little in the afternoon.  Eve'g. went to practice in the Dancing school at Bloomfield's.  Danced three or four times with the little misses of town.3 T.]  At 8 in the morning I attended the chemical Lecture where I saw proofs of the curious effects of respiring the Gaseous oxyd of Azote, or Nitrous oxyd.  Mr. Silliman, our professor, had prepared a quantity of this gas in gas vessels, and after the lecture was finished he gave liberty to any of the class to come forward and breath it.  Hubbard one of the class, offered himself.  It was to be respired by means of a silken bag, into which it was transferred.  The bag had a pipe and a stop-cock so that the gas could be sucked in & blown out again into the bag as often as anyone pleased.  Hubbard breathed the gas about a minute, when on removing the bag from his mouth, he exhibited a very ludicrous appearance.  He stood a little while motionless, and to appearance, with a considerable tension in his nerves.  He presently clench'd his fists and began to step towards Mr. Silliman and J. Strong (one of the class who was also on the floor of the Laboratory) making some expressions of laughter.  His face looked very red, and as we began to laugh to see him, he increased his laughter, and even extended it to a loud screaming laugh, at the same time stepping up to Strong, and with his fists still doubled, and swinging his hands, he began to dance.  The audience was considerable; it consisted of the class of about 70 in number, several ladies, together with the most of the faculty, and several gentlemen of town.  The whole Laboratory was in a roar to see the capers which Hubbard was cutting, and apparently from sympathy, the louder we laughed, the harder he danced & laugh'd.  He continued his dancing near a minute, till the effect dying away he gradually came to himself.  On being asked to describe what he had experienc'd he said it was impossible, but for the most part he was conscious of what he did; but he felt so much pleasure, and so strong a propensity in doing so that he could not refrain from it.	In the afternoon I saw several other experiments of the kind, all with a different effect.  In one instance the person took the position of an orator, and made several gestures, then burst out into a fit of loud laughter and flung himself into a chair.  This person on coming to himself said that he fancied himself in the British parliament declaiming on an important subject.4 F.] Recited as usual, and in the afternoon, walk'd with a party of Ladies and gentlemen to a grove on the far shore of East river, where we partook of some refreshments.  The party consisted of 12 couples, among which was Miss Grace Ingersol, and her intended, a French gentleman by name M. Greles.5 S.] Heard a Lecture on Muriate of Soda, or common sald.  Attended my dancing lesson.  Recited catechisms, and spent most of the afternoon at the public school of dancing.  Ev'g. fatig. and ret'd. early.6 Sunday] Somewhat unwell, did not attend meeting in the chapel -wrote a letter to Cox and slept most of the afternoon.7 M.] Wrote poetry - recited as usual.  Eve'g. walk'd home with Miss E. Dagget.8 T.] Heard a Chemical lecture on Nitre; recited Paley - read the reign of Jas. 2d.9 W.] Read the reign of Anne - attended recitations, dancing lesson, and at eve'g. Dancing school.10 T.] Heard Lecture on Nitre - assisted to examine Lin. library. - read the reign of George 1st, call'd at Mr. Hughes' and got some cherries.11 F.] Attended the recitations.  Rec'd. a letter from T. Lovell & Co. on business went to Milford with N. Taylor on that business.12 S.] Read some poetry, wrote a little &c.  To-day our class finished Paley's Philosophy, and heard our last Chemical lecture.       This evening was put into practice a little trick which Nat and I projected last evening, coming from Milford.  Mead, a fellow of the Junior class, had frequently been solicitous for Nat to shew him where he could find some of the Ladies of pleasure, which night-walk N. Haven streets.  Nat told him that at 9 this evening a fine plump little thing would be at a certain place.  Nat and I therefore, assisted by Mac (Nat's roommate) and Joel also of the Junior class, laid the trap which succeeded beyond expectation in imposing on Wag (so Mead is call'd).  We borrowed a gown and dress'd Joel in it, made him a nice pair of bubbies out of a couple of handkerchiefs, put his cravat on crossed and pinn'd the ends, and tied a white pocket handkerchief round his head.  Thus rigg'd, Joel really look'd quite enticing.  Mac & I accompanied Miss Joel to the ground, while Nat was to go with Wag and shew him where she was.  Arrived at the spot Joel pulls off his pantelloons, and the loose gown which he wore out to hide his female habit and gave them to us; we retired to a small distance and hid, while Miss Joel waited for the approach of her horny16 gallant.  As Nat & Wag approach'd the spot, they saw her, as Wag thought, waiting for them.  There she is, says he, by G----.  Nat offered him the first chance, but Wag not much accustomed to the business, and fearing lest it might be some other lass than the one Nat had told him of, and with whom he might be in danger of getting tail bitten, declined to approach her till Nat had determined the point.  Nat therefore went forward, and after staying some time with her behind a bush came back and told Wag that it was the same he expected and that he had experience'd her usual kindness.  At this information Wag rushed on in the heat of his Vinegar.  The scene which ensued was truly ludicrous, but such as cannot with decency be related, suffice it to say that Miss proved rather cross & after tormenting Wag 15 or 20 minutes in the most writhing pains, she broke from him and escaped, leaving him wholly ignorant of the deception.  On returning Wag observed to Nat that he never saw so cross a d---d bitch in his life, but said she had agreed to meet him at the same spot the next night.  He said she was a De-lish plump, fair skinned piece, he was sure he should know her again for he took good notice of her face.  After returning we all assembled and enjoy'd our sport at poor Wag's expense.13 Sunday] Attended meeting in the chapel.  Finished the Old testament, which I began to read about the beginning of last term.  Spent the evening at Mr. D. Daggett's in a company of 10 or 12.14 M.] Wrote a little in the morning.  From 9 to 11, rec'd. a dancing lesson.  At 11 we attended the recitation room, where as it was our last recitation in our collegiate course, after the regular business was closed, the Doct. spent about an hour in giving us some valedictory advice.  His observations were on Methodizing time,- on Exertion, & on the choice of friends.	On Methodizing time, the substance of what he said was this.  It is of incalculable importance to methodize time; no man can do much unless he does it.  Rise early, and exercise till breakfast.  Exercise is the soul of health, and the morning is the best time to exercise both because the body is then in the best state to receive benefit from it, and because the morning is an improper time to study.  Early reading will destroy the eyes.  Health and eyes are every thing to a student.  Eat a hearty breakfast.  The breakfast should always be the heaviest meal of the three.  After breakfast take up your most laborious studies, your mind is then clear, not perplex'd with previous study.  Your body is vigorous, both by your exercise and your breakfast; and of course you are then in the best condition to make exertion.  Use moderation at dinner,- then take up some trifling subject, till the mind gets clear, after which read history or works of taste.  Sup lightly and not very late.  Retire early that you may rise early.  Set apart an hour or half an hour every day for the study of language, and a short period you may become a complete linguist.  Write composition very often, for 10 to 12 years, in order to acquire a finish'd stile.	On Exertion he made many observations shewing that any man can do almost whatever he pleases if he is but content to make efforts.  He says universal experience shews, that what are usually call'd dull plodding fellows, are apt to compass the greatest things, and all because they are willing to make exertions.  What the world calls genius is a jackalathon on which if a man will depend, it will lead him into a swamp.  He proved the soundness of this doctrine by instancing Roger Sherman of this town & Bounaparte.  He says Bounaparte is not a man of greatest capacity of mind, but possesses infragable energy of conduct, he performs because he thinks he can perform, and so can every other man do much if he but thinks he can.  Every young man ought constantly to keep in mind the observation of Virgil, and make it his golden maxim, "possunt quia posse videntur."	On the choice of friends, he observed that we should be cautious.  Prove a person before you accept his intimacy.  Those that make the worst intimates will easiest be found, real friends are scarce, and hard to become acquainted with when found; they are hard to become acquainted with because they are cautious, and never wish to draw a person into intimacy with them with whom they are not acquainted.	He made several observations on reading and the choice of books similar to what is found in the latter part of Locke.  He condemned the Modern theoretic philosophy.15 T.] The Examination of our class, as candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Arts began this morning at 8.  During the forenoon we were examined in the Greek Testament, Homer, Tully de Oratore & Horace;- in the aft. we went through E. grammer, Geography, Priestley & Wattelle.  Spent the evening at Mr. Stewart's with Miss Ashman.  Ret'd. to Mr. Sherman's with Miss A. and from thence to College about 10; when in front of the Colleges I fell in with a kind of half riot between the Students & town fellows.16 W.] We were examined, in Webber, Enfield, Duncan, Locke & Paley,- and finished about 3 in the afternoon.  After the examination was ended there were several ceremonies gone through, in order as follows.  About 4 the bell was again tolled, we assembled in the Chapel and were attended by the faculty (except the Pres't) and examined.  A short address in Latin was read to us by the Butler, stating that our examination was approved, and that we all (mentioning all our names) were admitted as proper persons to graduate.  The Senior Professor (Mr. Day) then invited us all into the Philosophical chamber, where we found the Pres't. waiting for us.  The President then gave us a long address in Latin, complimenting us on our good behaviour and our acquisitions; and giving us advice for our future conduct, telling us "non ingenio, non labore, non fortuna, sed gratia Dei nitemini."  After the address was ended, Prince and two waiters, appointed from the Freshman Class, served us with Punch, Wine, Crackers, Cake, Cheese and Beef; and we spent the afternoon till prayer time in innocent conversation and festivity: the faculty and examiners the mean time honoring us with their presence.	At 8 I attended the Examination Ball, and spent the evening with a very pleasant party of about 19 ladies and 30 gentlemen, principally seniors.  Came home about 1 - bill at the ball $2.50.17 T.] Yesterday, also rec'd. a letter from Thos. Lovell & Co. stating that they accept Jas. Wood paymaster for 47 Dolls. they sent me;- also one from Levi.	Rose late this morning - spent part of the day in taking leave of my class mates who are going out of town.  Wrote a letter to Dr. Samuel Rowerly of N.J.18 F.]  Read Shakespeare's "Tempest",- read some in the Annual Review for 1803.19 S.] Forenoon attended court where four criminals were brought up and committed for forging bank-notes on the Manhattan company & Cheshire Bank.  Aftn. read the 3 vol. of Fessenden's works, his fugitive pieces.20 Sunday] Attended the Church where in the forenoon I heard Miss Grace Ingersol published to Mr. Peter Grelett.  They were married in the evening.  I spent the evening at Mix's garden again.21 M.] Wrote a letter to Betsey Crane, read Pope's Rape of the Lock and several other pieces of poetry.  Thought some on a plan for a poem to speak at commencement.22 T.] Read Pope's Temple of Fame.  Sketch'd out a plan for a poem at commencement.  Some time last week or week before Mr. Hoadley informed me that Mr. Daggett wanted somebody in his office, and had offered some little privileges to whoever would come and study with him.  The information came to Mr. H. From Mr. Stedman, and to him I was reffered for particulars.  I conversed with Mr. Sted. on the subject, and he agreed to go with me this evening and see Mr. Daggett.  At 1/2 past 7 we therefore went, I was introduced to Mr. D. by Mr. S. and agreed with Mr. D. to come into his office and stay at least till commencement, if he pleased.  He is to find me books give me whatever instruction I wish in the Law, charge me nothing for room rent fire wood and candles.23 W.] Walk to the gun factory before breakfast, after breakfast call'd and viewed Mr. Daggett's office.  Wrote some in prose on my subject for Commencement.  Evenign walk'd with Ely round one where and another.24 T.] Wrote about 40 lines of Poetry, and read in Mr. Daggett's Office the first chapter of Washington's life.25 F.] Read Blackstone's introductory Lecture, and the second vol. of W's. Life.  Evening wrote a few lines in my commencement poem.26 S.] Read three chapters in Smith View of Society in Europe and the third chap. of W's. life.  Evening wrote some more in my Poem.27 Sunday] Went to the Brick meeting.  Wrote a letter to Mr. S. Whelpley.28 M.] Read in Smith, Washington's Life &c, spent some time at court.  Ev'g. wrote the description of the habitation of the Muses in my poem.29 T.] Rose at 4, shaved and dress'd me, and went to Mr. Stewart's to breakfast.  At 7 I set out to go to Danbury with Mrs. Stewart, in company with Captn. E. Peck and his little daughter Rebecca.  I hired a horse of L. Bradley and rode in Mr. Stewart's chase.  We called at Derby 8-1/2 miles from N.H. and staid a few minutes.  Then went on 13 miles all the way on the East bank of the Housitonick, to Henman's tavern, where we arrived about 12 and staid to dinner.  At 1/2 past 2 went on to Newtown 4-1/2 miles, stopt there a short time, and proceeded to Danbury, 10 miles where we arrived about 7 o'clock the whole distance from N.H. being 36 miles.  I took tea at Esquire Clark's (Mrs. Stewart's father's) then went with Pelatial Clark to Mrs. Stan's to see Cox.  We did not find him till 9 - I conversed with him about 3/4 of an hour and returned to Squire Clark's to lodge.30 W.] After breakfast I went again to see Cox.  We took a ride together on horse back round the town.  Danbury contains between 2 & 3 thousand inhabitants, has a large Episcopal church, a presbyterian meeting house, a court house and jail (being a halfshire town in the county of Fairfield.)  It is situate principally in one street, which stretches to an extent of 2 miles pretty thickly settled.  The street is wide, but crooked and dirty.  The houses are mostly two stories, few more than 2 [i.e. 20?] years old, for the whole town, except two houses, was burnt by the British in 1780 or 81.  The town, by its situation reminded me of Lenox in Mass. though it is much larger and nto so hilly.  It is famous for the number of mechanics it contains.  There are more hats made here than in any town in Connecticut.  It seems to be, in the hatting business, what Newark in N.J. is in the shoemaking.  After dinner Cox and I came to Squire Clark's where we spent the Afternoon till 6 in company with Miss Laura Clark and Miss Rebecca Mygatt (whose name is pronounced Maggot).  At 6 Cox and I went and took tea at Mrs. Taylor's, widow of Col. Taylor.  We returned and spent the evening with the girls at the house of Dr. Carrington, the stepfather of Rebecca.  Cox lodged with me at Squire Clark's.31 T.] Rose at 5 - at 7 set out for home.  Arrived at Henman's about 11, staid a short time,- came on to Derby where we dined at 3.  At 1/2 past 4 we came on again and reached home 20 min. past 6.  I took tea at Mr. Stewart's - came to Bradley's and paid $4.50 for his horse ([illegible] Con. cen.) came to my room and retired 1/2 past 9, being somewhat afflicted with the squitters.1806 August1 F.] Took a walk in the morning.  After breakfast went to the Office.  Read to day in Smith & W's. life.  Evening wrote 13 verses of Poetry entitled 'The Modest Muse'.2 S.] Pursued my usual studies in the Office.3 Sunday] Did not go to meeting (ob Diarrh. uque existentem) wrote the speeches of Terpsichore, Polymnier & Erato.  Ev'g. spent at Mr. Daggett's with J. Ely.4 M.] Today finish'd Smith's view of Society - read some in Washington's life.5 T.] Wrote all day on my poem, wrote the speeches of five of the Muses.  This evening at the dancing school a fracas took place between the students and town-fellows.  The cause is of long standing, has been growing several months.  They fought with clubs,- several were severely bruised, but Guy Richard's of the junior class, at whom the principal animosity of the opponents was directed, felt the fray the most.  The sheriff was raised to quell it.  It took place about 10 o'clock and lasted some minutes with considerable heat.  There were about 20 on a side who fought.6 W.		} Spent most of the time in writing for Commencement.- wrote a letter to Levi in answer to one I rec'd.--wrote one to Jason Allen, and waited some on the girls.  Had a Devill of a turn of the Hypo-- felt as tho' I had rather go into non existence than write any thing for Commencement.7 T.		}8 F.		}9 S.		}10 Sunday	}11 M.		}12 T.] At 8 the trial of the rioters of last Tuesday evening came on.  Attended court all the forenoon and witness'd in the cause.  Afternoon studied, and at eve'g. went to dancing school.13 W.] Read in Washington's life.  Evening attended the Lin. Society.14 T.] Read in W's. life.  Began Sallust's Catalinian conspiracy, and at evening wrote a letter to D. K. Esty in Anapestic verse.15 F.] Forenoon read the 2d Camp. 2 vol. of W's life.  Read some in Sallustius.16 S.] Read papers - attended court to hear the trial of the rioters finished.  Attended dancing school.- read some in W's. life.17 Sunday] Attended meeting at the Chapel, and read 20 chapters in St. Matthew's gospel.  Spent the evening in walking with the Miss Daggett's and Dun.18 M.] Having relinquish'd the idea of exhibiting at commencement, I this morning began Blackstone.  Read some in Washington's life & in Sall't.19 T.] From 8 to 10 read in Blackstone.- from 11 to 12 in Sallust,- aftn. read the 3rd Chap. 2 Vol. W. Life.  Evening fiddled about with old Betsey Lines till I got my coat daubed in white paint, and after that I turned my attention towards cleaning it.20 W.] Studied Blackstone, Sallust & W. Life as usual.  Eveg. eat water melon at Mr. Staples.	Today Mr. Silas Richards & Lady came in town from Hartford where they have been on a visit.  They are from Savanah in June last an are now making their way to Morristown.  Mr. Richards being acquainted with Mr. Sanford brother to Mrs. Perrit with whom I board, he call'd to see him, and thus I happen'd to find him.  Mr. & Mrs. R. dined with us at Mrs. Perrit's, he told me much about Georgia and much about F. Fitch who lives in Sandersville.  Fitch is making cash rapidly - has bought him some negroes, and is becoming known about the country.21 T.] Studied Blackstone, Sallust & W. Life.  Spent some time in the U.S. circuit court which is now in session - judge Edwards on the bench.  Spent the even'g. at Mr. Daggett's with Susan & Miss Brown who has been with her a day or two - Mr. & Mrs. D. being both at Litchfield this week.22 F.] Read Sal. Black. & W. life.  Spent the evening at Hennen's room.23 S.] Studied as usual.24 Sunday] Read from 21st Chap. of Matth. to 12th of Luke.  Attended meeting in the chapel in the afternoon.25 M.] Read in Blackstone, finish'd Sallust's Cataline.  Read in W's. life.  This afternoon Cox arrived in town from N.Fork after an absence of 5 Mos.  I attended the dancing school this evening.26 T.] Read to the 7th Chap. in Blackstone.  Spent the afternoon riding with Cox to Morris' point in his gig which he lately bought in N.F. for $310.  While riding this afternoon Cox mentioned that he was going to Boston.  Offered me a seat if I would go with him, I agreed, and we set out in the morning.  Spent the evening in making preparations.  I am to pay the horse keeping and turnpike gates.27 W.] At six we set out; and concluding to go the Middle rout we started for Hartford on the turnpike, in as high stile as anything that has lately appear'd on that road.  Cox's horse is large, a bay colour, and carries well.  His Gigg is yellow, has a calash top, horizontal springs, and plated harness.  We breakfasted at Mrs. Tyler's - 14 miles from N. Ha.  The turnpike thus far is almost on a line; it crooks a little in one place only.  Meriden through which we pass'd is the halfway town;- it is small and dirty - in it are two 17 mile stones, one 17 from N. Ha. the other 17 from Hartford.  We call'd at Berlin, 11 miles from Hartford.  This town is the focal point of the Con. tincarts.  Thither they depart & hither they return from all directions, like the radii of a circle.  Arrived at Hart'd. about 3.  At the last turnpike gate through which we past is the handsomest prospect I have ever yet seen.  A tract of country is in sight lying on the Con. river, extending up and down it about 30 miles, and is perhaps 12 wide, from E. to W., in which are the towns of Windsor, E. Windsor, Hart'd. E. Hart'd. Weathersfield, Glastenbury, Middletown & one or two others.  This tract is all bottom land - it presents everything on which can be suggested by the word luxuriant.	At Hartford call'd on Bull, Mosely & G. Goodwin.  Left Hartford at 5, and went on to Pitchet's in Windsor, where we lodged.  We ret'd. about 9 - I spent 1/2 an hour in noting what I had seen, Cox meantime was killing bed bugs.28 T.] Rose at 5 - set out, 1/2 past, for Simsbury mines,- call'd in Granby & breakfasted at Holcomb's.  Conducted by the innkeeper, Mr. Holcomb, we went up to the mine on foot across the mountain, about 1-1/2 mile.	The prison wall encloses about 1/2 an acre; in which are a work house, a guard house, a cook house, & a lodging prison.  There are at present 45 prisoners all at work at nailing, except a shoemaker & several waiters.  The guard consists of 14 in number, officers included.  We first view'd the workshop,- saw the poor dogs chain'd to their blocks and thumping the anvils like so many Cyclops.	The lodging prison next attracted our attention.  This is a building lately erected, purposely to receive the prisoners at night.  They have lodged in it not more than a week (formerly they lodged in the mine.)  It is built of brick, and in my opinion is not very strong.	We next took a view of the cavern.  The descent into this is from the guardhouse.  In the back room, the corporal who conducted us, lifted up a catch and descended about 8 feet, we followed.  After lifting another hatch, we all descended perpendicularly 30 feet upon a ladder.  From the foot of this descent, we continued descending by a moderate crooked declivity a few rods, till we came to the two cabins where the prisoners formerly lodged.  From these cabins they had several times made their escape by digging out; in consequence of which the new prison was built.  From the cabins we descended, slanting and crooking, gradually bearing to the east; till we came to what is call'd the well.  This is in fact the wall of the yard, is 8 rods or more from the place of first descent, and 85 or 90 feet from the surface of the earth.  We were within about 10 feet of the bottom of it.  Returning beyond the cabin we took a survey of another hole which leads North, and is nearly as long as the other which leads to the well.  This hole or passage ends in a circular room or cavern, about 10 ft. Diam. and 8 high.  It is call'd the singing room in consequence of the musical reverberation of a sound when made here.  This room is immediately under the work shop, which stands some rods from the guardhouse.	We ascended and ret'd. with Mr. Holcomb to his house, whence we set out for Suffield about 1/2 past 11.	The punishment of imprisonment in Newgate, does not appear to me since seeing the place, so much to be dreaded as I apprehended.	We call'd at Suffield about 1 - came on 1/2 past and arrived at Springfield, 3.  Saw Bliss of our class.  View'd the bridge across Con. river, which was finish'd last October.  This bridge is between 12 & 13 hundred feet long.  There are but 5 piers, of course but 6 arches, each arch clear of the piers, being about 180 feet.  The arches are so long they are sinking.  On one they are erecting a frame to prevent it falling it.  The arches are too long, and of too large a curviture for strength.  Altho' this bridge cost $3500, it presents but a moderate appearance on the top, is inelegant & I think weak.  Chance if it stands a great while.	Left Springfield about 5 - came to S. Hadley falls where we lodged at Bishops.29 F.] Rose at 5 and took a view of the Locks and canals at this place.	The Canal is about 2-1/2 miles long; cut through in some places as much as 30 feet deep, and generally 12 or 15 feet wide.  The machinery for letting through boats is all at the lower end, just opposite the tavern where we staid.  This machinery consists of 3 Locks (each of which will raise 4 or 5 feet head),- an inclined plane about 100 feet long & elevated perhaps 25,- a large carriage on which the boats are drawn up and let down the plain; and the necessary wheels to work this carriage.	As we were about to start we had the pleasure of seeing a boat go through.  It came to the first lock, above which the water was as much as 4 or 5 feet higher than below it.  This lock being opened the boat floated through together with the water which gush'd in to fill the second.  Through this it pass'd as through the first, and presented itself to the third which is at the head of the inclined plane and immediately over the water wheels which draw up the boat carriage.  These locks are perhaps 40 feet long, and some thing wider than the canal in general.  The water is kept in them by two folding gates hung on hinges each side of the canal, and so fitted that the weight of the water, shuts them; and when shut they form an angle up stream of about 120º.  They open by wheels and chains.  When the boat had reached the third lock it was ready to be received into the carriage.  The gate was now hoisted and the water wheels set in motion to draw up the carriage which is commonly kept under water in a hole at the foot of the plane.  The carriage rose majestically, like leviathan, from the deep, and was carried up the plain in about 10 minutes.  It has 3 pairs of wheels, so proportioned to each other in size, that the floor, on which the boat rests is kept horizontal.  The chains are made in the manner of a watch chain,- the rivets an 1-1/2 inch in diameter.  When the carriage had reach'd the top of the plain, it was fastened by dogs and the water wheels stopp'd.  The Lock immediately above it was then opened and the carriage box fill'd with water; upon which the boat floated in.  The water was then let out and the boat rested high and dry upon the carriage.  After loosing the dogs the carriage descended by its own weight, groaning under its load; back water on the wheels regulated its motion - it went gradually down, sunk into the hole whence it had risen and the boat floated out into the lower canal.	Carrying up boats is only the reverse of what we saw.  The boat is first placed over the carriage in the lower canal; the water wheels are then started; the carriage rises and takes the boat, brings it up the plain and discharges it into the first lock; whence it passes the other two into the upper canal on a level with the river above the falls.	At 9 we proceeded on our journey, arrived at N.Hampton at 11; and concluding not to go immediately to Boston, proceeded up the Con. River.  Pass'd Hatfield, Whately & Deerfield.  Between Deerf'd. & Windsor in Con. the land tho' good compared with much of N.E. is not such as I expected to see on the River.  Much is sandy, much stoney, and none very rich.  It may however be call'd smooth.	Deerfield is one of the handsomest places I have yet seen.  There is a large tract of land on Deerfield river which is not fenced; it is probably it is flow'd in a fresh time,- it is entirely level, and vastly productive.  The town is handsome, contains perhaps 60 good houses.  Here we saw in the street, J. Chester & R. Dickerson; convers'd with them a little and came to Greenfield, (3 miles) where we lodged.	Greenfield is nearly or quite as large as Deerfield.  I think more beautiful.  At Mum's in this town we had very polite attention paid us.  He keeps a stage house and appears better used to company than any tavern keeper we have seen this side of Springfield.30 S.] Rose at 6 - found the horse gall'd with the collar.  We fed him and heartily sympathized in his sufferings tho' unable immediately to relieve him.  Came on 7 miles to Webster's in Bernardston to breakfast.  An excellent breakfast at 25 cents.  Here we fell in company with a Mr. Morgan of Vermont, who was going to Brattleboro.  He put his horse before the Gigg, and I rode ours.  We cross'd the Ver't. line about 1/2 past 11 - came on through Guilford & arrived at Brattleboro in Ver't. 1/2 past 1.	This is a considerable settlement, contains perhaps 60 houses, ll of which have been built within 25 years.  The township of Brattleboro contains another settlement nearly as large as this, 2-1/2 miles N.W.  That contains the meeting house &c.  This settlement is on the Con. River, 95 miles from Boston, & about 9 from the Mass. line.  There is a toll bridge across the river, which is at this place not more than 1/2 of its width at Springfield.	At 3 we left Brattleboro, cross'd the toll bridge and went down the Boston turnpike to Winchester 12-1/2 miles; 4 of which lies through the mountains in an uninhabited wild of Pines & Hemlocks, a fit place for robbers.  Thus did we enter and leave Vermont; making ourselves in that state not 5 hours long.	Winchester is in N. Hampshire, bordering on Mass. and is immediately East of Hinsdale, the S.W. town of the state.  We put up for the night at Parker's tavern.  The town contains perhaps 10 good houses, a meeting house two stores, a lawyer's office &c.	Soon after we drove up, I saw a little drummer blackguarding an Irishman.  Pat was a little in for it.  "An' fath", says Pat, "if you are a man, how many men am I?"	To night Cox feels pretty well, has had a long conversation with a physician about the "optic nerve" "tarnica cornea", Salivation &c, &c.31 Sunday] Rose 1/2 past 5 - concluded to alter our rout and directly to Portsmouth.  I call'd on a Mr. Alexander the Lawyer of the place and who has been to the Gen'l. court at Portsmouth, to get a list of the towns through which we must pass in the nighest and best route.	At 7 we set out - came 10 miles, to Swansy, to breakfast.  Staid here from 1/2 past 9 till 1/2 past 11 - We had a good breakfast and a funny one.  Cox was in good spirits the scintillations of his wit, were frequent.  On departing we were offered one half-dollar, and one quarter dollar bill in change.  Curse the New England banks if this is the way.  There is scarce silver enough in all N. Hampshire to make a dozen teaspoons.	We went to Keene, thence to Marlborough.  Here we called to feed at a tavern kept by a Mr. Shirtliff, a horse jockey, who swears with much fluency.  He takes his oaths, not "in the name of all the Gods at once", but By all the Gods of Glory.  Here our horse (Boenerges) in consequence of eating half a bushel of rye last evening at Parker's in Winchester, was taken with a kind of dolor ventris, and would not eat.  We led him to the pasture, he laid down and often look'd at his flank.  Oh that Melpomene would condescend to sing the woes of horses; I would here state a length poor Boen's sufferings!  He roll'd - he lopped his ears and groan'd,- speaking as plainly as he could, that he had, or was getting the Cholera Morbus.  Cox felt small - I felt less.  There is little fun in riding in a Gig without a horse to draw it.	Cox and Shirtliff banter'd a long time about swapping horses; but about 5 Boen appear'd to get better, and we came on.  From Shirtliff's, the first mile and an half of the road, which is the great turnpike from Walpole to Boston, lies up a hill.  On the top is a very extensive and grand prospect.  To the W. & N. the mountains rise one above another till they lose themselves in the smoke of an extended horizon.  To the S. & W. the prospect is cut off by high mountains 10 or 12 miles distant.  But on the E. in all the majesty of Atlas stands Mount Monadnock, one of the peaks mentioned by Morse.  It rises above the tops of the surrounding mountains, all of which are sizeable even for N. Hampshire as much as they rise from the beds of the rivulets that flow by them.  It is principally rock unclothed by vegetation; more particularly is this the case with the upper part.  Gently sloping on all sides, it ends in a single peak, which appears to be a rock about 50 feet in diam.  By the side of Mount Monadnock, in sight of which we have spent the most of the day, we travell'd 6 miles to Milliken's tavern, at the foot of its S. side.  Here we put up for the night.1806 September1 M.] Rose 1/2 past 5, found the horse much better, went 6 miles to breakfast.  (The parts of N. Hampshire through which we have come are extremely rough.  The whole face of the country seems broken up into mountains, as soon as you descend one you rise another and not a valley of any considerable size is found to separate them.  What rivers we have seen, either rattle over the rocks, and seem in haste to find a country which will afford them smoother beds; or sullenly loitering by the feet of the mountains, sink in seeming despair into the excavations they have made among the rocks.  Marlboro is a very high situation.  In this town, a bed of mountains of no mean appearance, seem to unite their tops to form a base for Mt. Monadnock.  On part of this base, which is larger than the mountain covers, stands the meeting house, an inn or two &c, about 3 miles from Monadnock.  The surrounding soil for a mile or two is productive.  Here is a large growth of White Pine & hemlock; the ground is stony but not so broken as in many places.  What we have seen of New Hamp. generally speaking, is extremely broken: much of the land cannot be cultivated.  The timber is mostly Pine & Hemlock, very large: some oak, chesnut, birch &c.  From Keene we have come on a turnpike, hilly but wide; free from stone and every way excellent for the ground on which it is made.  The toll is low, it averages about 20 cents for 14 miles, for horse and gig.)	Call'd at Page's in Ipswich.  Concluded here to go nearly or quite to Boston before we turn off for Portsmouth.  Came on through Townsend, to Groton in Mass. where we lodged.	Mount Monadnock appears to be the highest land in this part of the state of Hamp.  Not far from this mountain, rise two rivers, one of which empties into the Con. near Brattleboro; the other into the Merrimac at Concord in this state.2 T.] Set out at 6 - call'd at the town of Groton, to inquire the way.  On asking for a map of the state, we were referred to Mr. Butler, the teacher of the Academy.  Call'd on Mr. Butler and was treated very politely; he took us to the Acad. shew'd us a map of the state and one of the U.S. by Carleton, about the size of Bradley's.  Came 3-1/2 miles to breakfast.	Groton is a handsome town.  The buildings have the appearance of wealth.  There is in the settlement, perhaps 30 houses that are neat; in fact, they approach grandeur.  Here is an academy of 40 students, a meeting house & two taverns.  This is a well cultivated part of the country; the best we have seen since we left the state at Bernardston.  From Ipswich in N. Hampshire, the country has levell'd and fallen off almost to a plain; there are some hills, but nothing that merits the name of mountain.  Timber oak, white & birch pine, some spruce.	After breakfast drove to Concord, where we arrived about 1.	Concord contains I suppose 30 good houses, besides a number which are respectable.  Here is a large meeting house, a court house and school house.  The town is situated in shape of a T, the stem running N. & S.  All the public buildings are on the E. & W. Street, a little north of which on an eminence overlooking the town, in a grave yard, is the house which contain'd a part of the stores at Lexington.  The house is of brick, very small,- it would not contain more than a dozen barrels of powder.	A cold N.E. storm attended us during our stay in Concord.  At 5, we went 2-1/2 miles on the Lexington road, and put up at Brooks'.3 W.] The storm continued.  Here, as with Horace war broke out in my interior, which we kept firing all night.  Before breakfast I took a dose of Brandy and sugar, which in some measure appeas'd the spirit of turmoil that was raging within.  The forenoon Cox & I spent mostly in doing nothing - we talk'd a little, danc'd a little, & sung a little.  About 1/2 past 10, I went 20 rods or so from the tavern, to see an old Revolutionary worthy who shoulder'd his musket and chas'd the British as they went up to Concord in April '75.  This old gentleman whose name is Brooks, appear'd glad to see me.  He told me a long Cock & Bull story about what he thought, saw and did on the day of the battle of Lexington.  His story occupied about an hour.  It is too long to insert here.  I was highly entertain'd.  I must say - nay I am proud to say I feel the deepest reverence for the hardy sons of freedom who inhabit these parts.	At 1 we set out, the storm not yet over, and came through Lexington & Cambridge North parish to Charlestown where we put up at the Hotel.	In Lexington, by the road side, about 10 rods N. of the meeting house, is a MONUMENT erected in 1799 to the memory of those heroes who fell in that town, fighting for the liberties of America, on the ever memorable 19 of April 1775.  The monument is of the usual form which is seen in grave yards, about 15 feet high and of a proportionate size.  On it is an inscription containing the names of all who fell, and explaining the object for which it was erected.  It is made of a hard quarry stone, and appears so well put together that it will last for ages.4 T.] Rose about 5 and crossed Charles river bridge into Boston.  We went to the market, an infernal dirty hole as ever I saw, and found little or nothing there worthy of being seen in a market.  Ret'd. soon and after breakfast call'd to see Dr. Morse.  He was not in - gone to the state prison, over which he has some direction.  We went to the prison but the Dr. was engaged, we did not see him.  After returning to the Hotel we hired a horse of the landlord and went to Cambridge where we introduced ourselves to president Webber.  The Pres't. was polite enough to accompany us to the College where he shew'd us the various things worthy attention;- the Library, the apparatus, the paintings &c.  Their Library contains 14,000 volumes.  The old books, collected on the founding of the College and soon after, were all burnt, with the College about 1706.  Here is a very full philosophical apparatus, among which is an onery of considerable size.  I think the machine in its case is 6 feet diameter.  They have several pieces of elegant painting.  Their museum is much larger than ours at N.Haven.  But what attracted my attention as a curiosity, more than any other thing I saw was the chair, from which degrees are usually conferred.  This piece of mechanism baffles all description.  It contains at least 60 pieces of wood, tho' it is not larger than a common armed chair.  The history of it President Webber informed us, is clouded in fable; but among other traditions it is said to be made of a part of the timber of the ship in which Sir Francis Drake circumnavigated the world.	The Colleges here make but a purvy appearance, compared with that of ours at N. Haven.  It seems to have been the intention that they should front the public Green, about W.N.W. but they in fact stand heads and points, I can hardly tell how.  And to crown all other absurdities, there is a little building called Hollis Hall, stuck in the handsomest part of the front yard, with the end to the street.	President Webber is not Dr. Dwight: and what is more, he is not and never can be like him.  He is over the middle stature, has a blunt nose, grey eyes, heavy eye brows and a slow speech.  He possesses none of that volubility for which Dr. Dwight is so celebrated.  His corporeal system is formed on the agricultural plan, rather than for the man of science.  He is undoubtedly a man of strong mind, of good disposition, and great mathematical knowledge.  Scarcely an idea he starts but is square, triangular, or of some other mathematical shape.  But he cannot, I think, be a man well calculated to impart, that kind of knowledge which the Pres't. of a College ought to give to those under his more immediate direction.  He is a sorry lump of clay, out of which to fashion the head of the first literary institution (as it is called) in the U. States.	We returned, and after dinner went again over to Boston, where we had a most excellent view of the town from the top of the State house.  Ret'd and went to Roxbury in the Gig.5 F.] At 7, set out for home.  Came over Chas. river bridge and through Boston main street.  This street is the best in the town.  It begins at Fanuel hall, and running southward across the neck quite out to Roxbury, [illegible] its width and is paved all the way, probably between two and three miles.  It is not straight, nor is it call'd Main St. all the way.  Some parts of it resemble Pearl street in N.York, except that it is hardly as wide nor are the buildings as rich.  Here is transacted a great part of the dry-good business of the town.  At Fanuel hall, where the market is, the street breaks into a number of narrow, crooked, dirty, devilish little lanes as are to be in the most irregular parts of N.York.  It is astonishing to me that the Yellow fever [words missing?] these sons of filth who inhabit this hole.  In fact the whole town of Boston is far inferior to N.Y. in point of cleanliness.  In a wet time the streets are quite muddy and the top of the pavements.  The west part is handsomest: here are a few straight streets and elegant houses; but on the whole the town is dirty irregular and unpleasant.  The state house is something worth the Bostonian's boast.  It stands on the south side of Beacon hill, and has the Common in front.  Viewed from the Common it presents a more magnificent appearance than any other building I ever saw.  It is three story: and above the common roof a dome of perhaps 50 feet diameter, rises in all the stateliness of a Roman capital.  Under the dome a hexagonal lanthorn, in each side of which is a 24 light window, completes the building.  From this lanthorn, I saw, yesterday afternoon, Mount Monadnock in N. Hampshire; at the foot of which we lodged last Sunday evening.  The dimensions of this State house I do not know; it is certainly larger than any other building I have ever seen, but will be surpass'd by the N.Y. city hall.  Standing on so high a situation, and being so much larger than any other building in Boston, when viewed from the neighboring eminences, of Chas.town or Roxbury, it forms a complete apex to the whole town.	Altho the town of Boston is not remarkable for anything but irregularity and filth, the country road is certainly fine.  Boston is situate on a peninsula united to the main land on the south, by a neck just wide enough for a street of convenient width together with building lots on each side.  Roxbury is on the main land, the buildings of which run down and unite with those of Boston on the neck.  Cambridge, a handsome and thickly settled town, lies on the west and communicates with Boston by the west bridge, which together with its causway is more than a mile long.  On the North lies Chas.town, larger than either Cambridge or Roxbury, and is united to Boston by the Chas. river bridge.  When all these towns are viewed from the top of the Statehouse, the eye is presented with a wild variegated view of houses, steeples; hills, rivers, bays and bridges; and the observer fancies himself in the midst of a thinly built city 20 or 30 miles in circumference.	As we came out of Boston it began to rain again: we drove to a tavern, 2 miles from Roxbury meeting house, on the Dedham turnpike where we breakfasted.  A rare tavern this, to be sure, for the neighborhood of Boston!  We call'd for eggs, they had none;- beef stake, they had none;- coffee, ditto;- we then desired the landlady (who happened at this time to be somewhat corpulent, and was dress'd in a kind of old frock-gown which hung loose from her shoulders) to get us such a breakfast as she could muster.  She shewed us into the parlour, and presently brought in some brush and barrel staves to make a fire.  We occupied ourselves for some time in surveying the splendor of this apartment.  Over the fireplace hung five or six little paintings, of Plenty, Peace, Spring &c, &c. each about as large as a common sized clamshell.  Strung round the wall was eight tin candle-sticks, in each a small piece of candle, and above them a streak of soot and lampblack, similar to a canvas representation of an eruption of Etna or Vesuvius.  In one corner of the room stood a clock, elegantly ornamented with a rocking ship in the upper part of the face.  Six old windsor chairs stood about as tho' they fell in a shower.  Under one window stood an antiquated Long island table, with 6 legs, all curiously wrought in the Lathe; and on the chimney piece was placed, by way of summer ornament, a japanned tin tumbler, fill'd with sprouts of liveforever.	Breakfast was at last brought: some slices of mutton, bread & butter, a kind of applepye shortcake & a dish of tea.  After breakfast we run some bullets for our pistols which we had bought in Boston, and at 8 the storm abating, we came on.  Call'd at Walpole at the halfway house (half way between Boston & Providence) where we eat two applepyes, and tried our pistols at a mark.  Came on to Haton in Attleboro, where we put up.6 S.] Rose early and came to Providence to breakfast.  At pautucket, 4 miles from Providence, we left the turnpike, on which we had rode all the way from Boston.  This is the best turnpike I ever saw; especially that part of it which lies between Boston and Dedham a distance of 9 miles.  This part is said to be equal if not superior to the Salem turnpike, which is usually called the best in the U. States.  From Pautucket, which is in the line between Mass. & R.I. states, the road is of a piece with the general appearance of R. Island improvements.  Little else is to be seen or felt in it but deep sand and large stones: it is intolerable to any one but a Rhodeislander.	Afte rbreakfast we went into the steeple of the Baptist church in Providence, from which is a good prospect of the town.  At Ammidon's met with Thos. Kinney of Newark (N.J.), here for his health: he accompanied us to the College and across the bridge into the west part of town. of Prov. is quite irregular, Westminster street, leading from the market across the bridge westward is the best looking st. in town.  It is of a convenient width, is paved as is most others of note, and is straight for about a quarter of a mile.  This town is supposed now to contain 8 thousand inhabitants.	At 1 we came down the E. side of Narraganset bay, through Warren (10 miles from Prov.) containing probably 1500 inhabitants, and reach'd Bristol, 4 miles farther, a town of 2 thousand inhab:- here we put up for the night.  Bristol is handsome.  The main street is straight for about 1/2 a mile, and each side for this whole distance is set out with Lombardy poplars.  This street runs parallel with the shore of the bay, not far from a N. & S. direction, and is about 10 rods, in general, from the water.  Before this town, lies several ships, and a considerable number of sloops & smaller vessels.  What we have seen of Rhodes Island, thus far, certainly presents evidence of a bad state of society.  The land is good, it is excellent, but fences, roads and buildings seem on the decline.  Some good houses appear in the towns; but the country appears "nothing less than Majesty deform'd, Archangel ruin'd."7 Sunday] Left Bristol after breakfast, cross'd B. Ferry, 3 miles from the town, and entered on the Island of Rhodes.  This land is the garden of N. England.  Not a spot of waste land is found on it; all is cultivable, and most is highly cultivated.  The farms are large, well fenced with stone wall, and the crops look extremely well.  There is no timber growing on the island.  As we pass'd down to Newport, we saw some orchards, so thick and flourishing, & the grass so green beneath the trees; that I was put in mind of the Elysian fields, and was in a partial expectation of seeing Ajax & Dido stalking through the shade.  We reach'd Newport, 11 miles from the ferry, about noon.  At 3 we cross'd the two West ferries, and put up at Gardner's, in South Kingston.  This whole day, as well as most of the past week has been rainy.8 M.] A stormy East wind blowing in the morning, we hired a couple of horses, and rode down to the ocean to see the surf.  A boy, as droll as Esop accompanied us; his name is Zaccheus Young, Zack was the source of all the pleasure we had on the ride, for it rained considerably, and drove us back without getting a sight at the surf.  Zack's retorts were frequently laughable.  Cox asked him which of us he thought the horse we had belonged to.  Neither, says Zack, I suppose you stole him.  I told Zack I was a Judge, & had been ever since I was a boy.  "And you're nothing but a boy yet", says Zack.	We came on at 9, and travelled 14 miles, to Stanton's, in Charlestown, where we dined.  This 14 miles is the worst, absolutely the worst road, I was ever on.  Altho' a post road, and considerably travelled, as it lies directly between Newport & N. London; it is worse than any other piece of the same extent I ever saw open; even in the most unfrequented parts.  The rod, in many places is very sandy: where it is not so, the ruts are full of loose stones, the size of a man's head and smaller.  The land on this route is excellent for grass; but the fences and buildings are infamous, enough so to disgrace any set of people in the U. States except the inhabitants of R. Island.	Stanton is a clever fellow, lives well and gave us a good dinner.  We left at 3 and came on to Pauctuc, 12 miles, where we stopped & took a watermelon &c.	PAUCTUC is a small town huddled round a bridge which crosses a river of the same name.  The river separates the States of Con. & R. Island: the most of the houses are on the R.I. side.  In the town are two grist mills & a saw mill; two taverns, a post office & the WASHINGTON bank.	It was about 6 when we crossed the bridge and bid a farewell to R. Island:- and a final farewell I think it will be for me, should I live even to Methusaleh's years, unless the system of things in this state is altered.  Providence, I confess, is somewhat flourishing but is too hilly and irregular to be pleasant.  Newport has been pining with a consumption these 20 years; the houses are old, mostly wood & but 2 stories high.  Warren is a hole of musquitoes.  Bristol might pass were it situated in any other pat of the world.  The land in the state appears generally good.  The Island of Rhodes is naturally a garden.  For either from some defect in the state gov't. or from a low ebb of public spirit, the country presents very little which appears to me inviting.	We lodged at Noyes', in Stonington.9 T.] In the morning I swapped watches with Noyes' son, and got $5 boot.  Set out at 7 breakfasted at Groton on ham & eggs.  At 1 we reached the west side of the Thames; came on through N. London without stopping except to buy a watermelon which we saw lying in a shop window.  Call'd at father Crocker's, Ropeferry, where we watered our horse & eat our melon.  This stop cost us 6 cents in cash.  Our next call was on goody Chadwick.  Here we treated ourselves to a hot applepye, baked on a deep platter, and well finish'd even to the spicing of it with fennel seed.  Gave the old lady 1/4 of a dollar came on into the hills where we met a boy riding an ox.  We reach'd SayBrook for about sunset, and even till 8 getting over: wind dead ahead and very weak.  Lodg'd at Pratt's in Saybrook two miles from the ferry. 10 W:] We now had 36 miles to ride, & this was the day of COMMENCEMENT.  Breakfasted at Killingworth, dined at Branford, and reached N.Haven about 5 o'clock - went direclty to the brick-meeting and found Wilkinson on the stage, just begun Valedictory Oration.  We attended, in our turn on the stage, to receive our degrees as Doctor conferred them, and at sunset I retired to my boarding house, Mrs. Perritt's not very well.	Such is the state of my health that I have quit study, and a break in the date of this memorandum must ensue.       During the whole of my residence in college I was at times alarmed with symptoms of approaching consumption.  In the course of the summer I have had them more frequently.  About the last of June I was seized with a pressure at the breast, and turns of faintness.  To remedy these causes of complaint I relax'd in my studies, put a strengthening plaster on my breast, and took iron filings; by which means I was relieved in about 3 weeks.  Soon after our final examination in July, I undertook to write a poem for commencement, proceeded considerable way in it, but did not complete it before I found my self attended with a cough, and difficulty for breath at first waking in the morning, accompanied with considerable expectoration during the morning and fore part of the day.  I was advised to use remedies.  On application to Dr. Munson, he put a plaster of Burgundy pitch between my shoulders, gave me a balsam to facilitate expectoration and ordered me occasionally to inspire ether.  I was obliged to relax again from study, and found that the perplexity of preparing for commencement was incompatible with the suppression of my indisposition.  Toward the latter part of August, the simptoms of my disease still increasing I thought a journey might be of service, and accordingly went with Cox to Boston.  But during the journey I was unavoidably exposed, at times, to damp atmosphere & night air, and on my return found myself farther from a recovery than when I set out.  My disease now became somewhat alarming, more however, on account of its long standing and obstinacy than the hight to which it was risen.  Dr. Munson now gave me Digitalis & Balsam capevi; and ordered me to keep close in bad weather.  All this answered no purpose, my cough & expectoration encreased and some mornings the expectorated phlegm was deeply streaked with blood.  I determined to come home, for I had wholly quit study.	Tuesday evening, the last day of September, I came on board of the Adeline, for N.Y. where I arrived the next evening.  I reached Morristown, Friday evening and went to Mr. Whelpley's more out of health than ever.  On an expectation of assisting Mr. Whelpley in the Academy, I concluded to remain at his house till I should get better.  Dr. Pierson was call'd for assistance, he gave me a few doses of Ipecac, and in a few days ordered a blister on my breast.  I was partially relieved: but the symptoms again encreased after the blister was done running; for in the multiplicity of exercise which about this time I was taking on horseback, I had been too much exposed.  The first of November, finding it inconvenient to give Mr. Whelpley any assistance, & the prospect of my being restored speedily being not very good, I went to Mr. Meeker's to stay a few weeks, when I could, with more convenience pay attention to myself.  Another blister was now laid upon my breast.  The effect of this was manifest, so that by the 10 I found myself apparently in a fair way to be relieved.  I confined myself to a vegetable & milk died, used exercise in good weather, but kept close in bad: and by these means got the better of my disease rapidly and was enabled to read considerably.  On my first arrival at Morristown, I had entered my name in S. D. Russell's office; and while at Mr. Meeker's I read some in Blackstone, as well as in Gordon's America.	About the 15th of Nov. Mr. Wood was taken with a violent turn of inflammatory rheumatism; he could not attend to his business.  He wished me to go to town and give Levi some assistance in the store till he should be able to return himself.  I went, took care not to expose myself unnecessarily to the weather, but attended to customers as occasion required: employing what leisure moments I could, in the study of Blackstone & Hume's England.  A fortnight thus pass'd & I continued to mend.  By the first of December, my cough had entirely subsided, my morning expectoration was diminished beneath notice, & my prospect for established health, was renewed with redoubled splendor.  Mr. Wood, recovered of the rheumatism now returned to the store.  I made an agreement with Mr. Canfield, to board with him this winter, my whole expense for board, washing, lodging, room rent, wood and candles, $2 p. week, I occupying his back room in the new store.	Thus am I, this 5th day of December, restored to health, encreased in flesh, and in a very convenient situation to prosecute my studies.  Today, I spent an hour and an half of the forenoon in the Academy, have read the 20 chap. of II Blackstone, and finish'd the reign of Edward 2nd in Hume.  At 8 in the evening accompanied Miss S. Wetmore home from Mr. Canfield's, the first feat of gallantry since I left N. Haven.1806 December6 S.] Forenoon read Hume in the reign of Edward III.
