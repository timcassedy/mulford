COMPOSITION WRITTEN BY D. MULFORD PROBABLY IN MORRISTOWN.
December 30th, 1801.

       My curiosity led me to go last evening to a Meeting of the Methodists at the house where the wonderful works was seen last week.  When I came there, service was begun.  The same Priest that I heard on Sunday evening was addressing the people in a very moderate and pleasant manner.  Soon as I arrived a hymn was sung, much in the same unskillful manner as on Sunday evening and they proceeded to prayer in which the priest displayed a great deal of energy.  While he was praying a young man that stood near me began to tremble appearing in great pain, sometimes he would get down on his knees, then sit down, then stand up and extend his hands toward heaven, continually calling on God.
	When the priest had ended his prayer, he took the bible, and read the twentieth verse of the ninth chapter of Acts for the subject of his discourse, Scrip.  "And Straightway he preached Christ in the Synagogues, that he is the Son of God."  He introduced his discourse by telling what he believed and had seen of the power of Jesus Christ and that we might expect to see some of it that night, and after intimating that it was that that caused the trembling of the young man above mentioned, he told us with an high voice which he was obliged to speak in on account of the groans and sighs of the people, that he believed Jesus Christ was then in the house.  Methinks (says he) I can see him and the angels of God hovering close over our heads, and consider what an awful thing it is to be in the presence of the Almighty!!!  Some, continued here, may be vain enough to disbelieve the reality of these things, but I'll tell you my friends, what I myself have seen.  When I was on my first circuit, I was at a meeting in the Meeting House at the Cross Roads in Delaware, where I was witness to an instance of a man's being struck dumb by the power of God.  The Tavern keeper of Dover a drunken very wicked man, came around the meeting home half drunk laughing and making game of our proceedings and in an instant of time he dropped to the ground motionless and senseless, in which state he remained several hours foaming at the mouth like a boar, and when his senses were restored he rose up glorifying God in the full assurance of his salvation.
	At another place a preacher was preaching Christ's power displayed on mortals, and he desired that man (if there was such a one in the assembly) that did not believe Jesus Christ had power on earth to forgive sins, to step forward and make himself known.  Presently up steps a stout hearted fellow, an officer of the Army, by his dress with a cigar in his mouth, and cries out "I am that man."  Very well says the preacher every man has a right to his own opinion but let us try now how many we will find on the other side, and dear me, I suppose there was a hundred that held up their hands and were witnesses for Jesus.  I then looked to see what had become of the stout hearted fellow and behold he laid on the floor senseless and was carried out for dead.  I left the place three hours afterwards left him in the same state, and whatever became of him I cannot tell.
	When the Priest came upon his subject he preached Christ in the offices of a prophet, Priest and King, the son of God and judge of the world and several times he stopped and entreated the people to keep in fervent prayer to God for his blessings and then would go on again in a very exalted voice.  But before he ended his sermon the young man who had been continually acting in the manner described for an hour or more, became easy and two children of about ten years was deprived of the use of their limbs.  After the sermon was finished and another prayer made, the meeting closed.  The people began to disperse and the two helpless children were laid on the bed.  I went and looked at them a considerable time.  They for the most part laid still with their eyes shut, but as often as once in five minutes or perhaps oftener, would clap their hands violently and utter 'O Jesus', 'Lord sanctify my love' or some such phrase.  Among a number who stood by the bed looking at them, were two physicians, who nursed them, and said that their pulse was fifteen too high and very full.
	While we were viewing the victims, the Methodists, except three or four who were with us, alternately prayer, had commenced a class meeting in the other room.  I was then invited to go and see their proceedings by a friend who was one of the class.  We there found three more laying on the bed, one a young woman who prayed continually with all her might the others I supposed to be near the age of the first two and acting in a similar manner, while the members of the meeting stood confusedly on the floor, singing praises to God with a great noise, and stamping with their feet, having their hands and faces directed toward heaven.  After singing in this confused manner for the space of a quarter of an hour or so, they betook themselves to prayer, then to singing again.  Thus they continued to go from praying to singing and from singing to praying as long as I stayed with them.  I had been waiting a long time to see what might be the end of those strange things, without seeing any apparent alteration in any of them, when the Methodist Priest began to discourse with our priest, Mr. Force, and at length asked him what he thought of those people on the beds.  Mr. Force answered that as they were all of weak and timid constitutions who were affected, he believed that a man of philosophical knowledge, and even without much, might support a good argument, that the events flowed from natural causes.  The methodist said that if that was his opinion he would show him an instance that he could not deny to be the work of God.  He led him into another room.  I followed them to see what it might be.  There a lad of about sixteen who had during the meeting been very melancholic, sat in a chair clapping his hands, shoving his feet and muttering "Glory to God" repeatedly.  "What is the matter my boy" says Mr. Force  "I Glory to God" says the boy.  The question was again put to Mr. Force what he thought of them.  He answered that their language appeared to be mechanical, for he heard nothing oftener than "Glory be to God" and the like, all about the house and that he should suppose a soul possessed of a divine spirit would probably speak wonderful things.  Mr. Force asked the boy who was continually in motion and crying to God, if he was ever so before.  He answered "yes", "the Lord has converted me four or five times but I fell from it."  Are you not afraid you will again says Mr. Force.  "O Glory to God, Glory to God" says the boy.
	Mr. Force and the Methodist's widely differing in opinion, entered into a pretty warm debate, which when the boy saw he got up and stood silent, ceased to clap his hands and appeared as composed as any one in the room.  I went once more to see the two first that was affected, then to the class meeting and the others on the bed, and found them all much as before.  Therefore it being now mid-night and no signs of an end to their proceedings appearing, I left them and came home.  A just description of this uncommon meeting can by no means be had from my unaccomplished pen nor do I believe anyone can conceive the amazing confusion there was of prayers, weepings, groans, sighs, stampings, singing, clapping of hands, rejoicing, etc., without seeing and hearing them himself.
	D. MULFORD.
