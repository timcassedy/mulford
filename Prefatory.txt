Diary of Daniel Mulford1801-1808Transcribed by Tim Cassedy, 2014The manuscript diary was donated to Yale University in 1911 by Daniel Mulford's grand-nephew, Stephen S. Day of Morristown, N.J.  It is at Yale's Beinecke Library (GEN MSS 509, Series II, box 3, folder 25).During the 1910s, apparently at several different times, several typescript copies of the manuscript diary were made.  One copy was sent to the Library of Congress, where it remains (LCCN: mm 82033852).  One copy was given to the donor, Stephen S. Day.  Mabel Day Parker subsequently used Stephen S. Day's copy to produce another typescript copy - this one somewhat abridged - which is now at the Morristown-Morris Township (N.J.) Library (HM51 MORR ACAD MUL), and one is at the Georgia Historical Society (MS 579).In 1961, Rutgers University microfilmed one of the typescripts.  At least three copies of that microfilm exist: one is at Rutgers University's Special Collections, one is at the Family History Library in Salt Lake City, UT (film #888801), and one is owned by Tim Cassedy.Several of the typescripts have extensive handwritten annotations supplying additional information about the characters and events described in the diary.This transcript was made in 2014 by Tim Cassedy from the Family History Library's copy of the 1961 Rutgers microfilm of one of the typescripts of the diary.  In general, this transcript ignores any handwritten text, except where typographical errors have been corrected by hand.Transcription guidanceMulford never uses square brackets.  Anything in square brackets has been added by me, or by the person who made the typescript.  Anything out of square brackets is Mulford's words.  Exception: in a few cases, Mulford writes in Greek.  I have transliterated these passages into Roman letters in square brackets.[illegible] indicates either that the manuscript was unreadable to the person making the typescript (in which cases the typescript reads as follows: .......) or that I was unable to make out the typescript.Passages in secret code, Latin, or Greek are more likely to contain transcription errors.
Daniel Mulford, born,Passaic valley, N.J.1-1/2 miles westof Turkey (NewProvidence) Sept.17, 1781.[Here the typescript contains several pages of handwritten as well as typed notes reflecting research into some of the persons named in the diary.  It's unclear which of the typed notes reflect text in the diary and which reflect later research.  I have skipped this material for now.  This transcript about 10 pages into the typescript, where daily entries begin, seemingly in March 1801, in the form of an undated financial ledger.  Beginning May 1, 1801, Mulford abandons the ledger form.]Paid outHad by me in the morning£ S d# S d0 1 0do1do0 1 0for Rus { went to the rejoining and at night to Benamin Willcocks's and to Levi's, waited on Smith Watchet home.doat Night went to Mr. Williams's & to John Mills's Spinning FrolicNonecame home and Went to William Beboutsdostayed at homedoBorrowed of J.
