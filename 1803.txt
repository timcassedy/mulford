1803 January1 S.] As I said in the introduction to my last years Memorandum, so shall I say now, that my present employment and prospect are both agreeable.  I was at the commencement of last year employed in going to school, and had the expectation of getting into a store in Philadelphia.  In which altho I was disappointed, mye mployment and manner of living throughout the year was not unpleasant.  I am now engaged in tending Store, which I like, and am in hopes of getting employment in one in some city sometime the course of the ensuing winter.  Or, if I should be disappointed in this, my determination is, to enter in the Spring in to the study of Physic.	This day I tended store for Mrs. Wetmore. [illegible] cum Wm. Beach et aliis, ad G.

His belief in the unit and perfection of the Deity was the same as theirs; he differed from them only in his opinion of Men's future state; which was this: That those who love and serve their maker go to a place of perfect happiness which is eternal - those who are very wicked, to a place of eternal misery; But that those who are neither very wicked, nor serve the Deity to the best of their knowledge, but live as it were in a middle state between good and evil, will have a time given them after death in which they will be purified, and afterwards enjoy perfect and indestructable happiness.13 Sunday] A very stormy day - I rose about 8 o'clock and read in Rollin - finished the fourth volume and went to Mr. Whelpley's about 2 o'clock and got the 5th.

Went to Uncle Samuel Dodge's and died.  Aftn. saw a certain Mr. Ford with whom I said something about coming into his store, but his proposals did not altogether suit.  towards evening saw Jacob Lewis who told me he wanted.  went again to Mr. Robins' - then to Mrs. Dodge's where I took tea, and then went to the play with Andrew.  Saw a Tragedy call'd A Tale of Mystery - Farce Retaliation.22 T.] Breakfasted again with Mr. Robins, went with him to Col. Swarthout's - saw Mr. Lewis again and talked more of a bargain, went again at evening to see Mr. Robins, who approved of the agreement I was about making with Mr. Lewis - came to Mr. Lewis' and finished the agreement with him.- lodg'd at the Ferry-house.23 W.] Came home with Mr. Crane, through a very severe storm of snow.  arrived at Mr. Canfield's about 1/2 past seven.24 T.] Was at Mr. Canfield's till 10 o'clock - went to Mr. Meeker's settled with him all accounts and passed receipts.  Afternoon came again to town and paid S. Johnson 11/s I owed him, and prepared to go to New York.  At night, returned with Mr. Wood in the sleigh to Mr. Meeker's, where I lodged.25 F.] Came, early in the Morning, to Town with my trunk - took breakfast at Mr. Canfield's.  Set out at 8 for New York, in Mr. Crane's stage.  As I was about setting out, I called at Mr. Whelpley's - Mr. Whelpley told me, that as I was going into a place where I would find many allurements to pleasure, and many obstacles to my future welfare, he must give me a little advice, which he would comprise in these few words; That I must not become a BUCK too soon.  We arrived at Newark 1/2 past 1 - saw Mr. Canfield then arrived at Mr. Lewis' in New York about 6 o'clock.26 S.] This day I commenced my apprenticeship at the mercantile business.  My agreement with Mr. Lewis is as follows - I am to live with him, and serve him in his store, the term of one year, for which he is to give me my board without washing, and 50 Dollars beside.	About 1/2 past 12, Mr. Lewis asked me to take a walk while he could speak with his clerk, whom, he had before told me, he intended turning off on account of misconduct.  I told Mr. Lewis I wished to speak with him before he did with his clerk: he bid me say on.  I told Mr. Lewis that if he appear'd penitent, and wished to continue with him, I was willing that our agreement should be void: because I should be quite unhappy to have him turned off in consequence of an agreement made with me provided it was otherwise convenient that he should stay.  I walked out, when I returned he was packing his clothes, and he left the store in a short time.	To-day his brother who was a clerk next door was also turned off for misconduct.  These two examples of the fate which immorality and dissipation commonly meet, and the good advice which I have lately had from some of my best friends, will render me altogether inexcusable, if I do not shun bad company, and establish for myself a good character.27 Sunday] Went in the forenoon to the Baptist meeting with Mr. Fitch - aftn. staid at my boarding-house et pauca legit.28 M.] Staid in the Store - Today we traded considerable - Carried to Mrs. Dodge's a square of cambric muslin to make into handkerchiefs.29 T.] About noon Adolphus returned, and Mr. Lewis agreed he should stay with him till May.

Aftn. went with Adolphus to an Auction house for goods Mr. Lewis had bought in the morning.  At evening went to see Mr. Robins.1803 April1 F.] Attended to the store as usual.  Read in Johnson's Introduction.  By Mr. Crane rec'd. a letter from Henry Russell which I answered and also wrote to Mr. Wood.  Vespera, Adolphus mihi dixit, se Hispanicam vel Gallicam scabiem habere, et mihi instruxit de illoc vorbo, quod nunquam antes audebam.2 S.] Sent my letters by Mr. Lewis who this morning went to Morris.  Finished reading Johnson, returned it and got from the library Tooke's PANTHEON, a treatise on the Mythology of the Heathen Gods.  Read some in it.3 Sunday] Went to Mrs. Dodge's before meeting, returned and stay'd with Mr. Fitch till noon, and read in Tooke's Pan.  Aftn. went to the Baptist meeting with Mr. Fitch.  After meeting walked about the city.4 M.] Staid in the store - read in Tooke's pantheon.5 T.] Ditto.  Returned Tooke's pantheon - got Russell's Ancient Europe.  At evening Mr. Wood arrived in town.  I went to see him but could not find him.6 W.] Ditto -- Spent part of the evening with Mr. Wood.7 T.] Ditto-- This evening Stephen Day call'd to see me.  Spent the evening with him - at nine o'clock went with him to Conklin & Day's Store, and to Daniel Day's No. 100 Read Street.

This evening also arrived from Morris Town the two Mr. Whelpleys, and Mr. Keyes.  Spent a part of the evening in their company - saw Mr. Wood again.9 S.] Was in the store - Sent a letter to Charles Russell by Mr. Wood.  At evening went to see George Wetmore.10 Sunday] Rose at 7 and went down to the market - after breakfast went to Mrs. Dodge's - went to meeting.11 W.	}12 T.	}13 W.	} Attended to the store - nothing material took place - I experienced some dissatisfaction in my situation.14 T.	}15 F.	}16 S.	}17 Sunday] A very snowy day.  Went to Mrs. Dodge's where I stay'd till after dinner- came home - call'd on George Wetmore at Mr. Andrew Ogden's - Walked out with G. and Alex Wetmore - they led me to a tavern, where we tossed a copper for, and I lost, a Gin sling, for which I paid 25 cents, went on with them, till I began to fear they would lead me astray still farther; then turned, and after many entreaties from them to go on, I came home and left them in the street - read some in Hist of America.  At evening went to Doct. Baldwin's and Rob't. Dodge's.	From reflecting on my little adventure to-day with the Wetmores, I conclude, and bear it still stronger in mind than ever, that in my present situation, almost destitute of cash, I must keep out of all needless and unprofitable company.18 M.] This aftn. in pursuance of some advice I received last winter from G. H. Ford, Esq. I went to the counting house of G. & K. pro nationibus olim inderendis.-- neither of them in, learned where they live.	At evening went to Uncle Sam. Dodge's - saw there two Wm. Dodge's daughters - Mr. Ezek. Dodge asked me to take a walk with him and the ladies.  We went to Mrs. Todd's - saw there James only - staid till near 9.  All went to Mr. Wm. Dodge's saw there three young men I was not acquainted with, - was not introduced to them - felt as foolish and as little as the D-l, and after a short stay bid the company a good night and came home.-this another foolish and unprofitable little adventure; complying with the invitation I received, I esteem an error in judgment, inasmuch as I was not acquainted with the ladies, when we set out on our walk, nor knew where I should be obliged to go, to accompany them home.19 T.] At 8 this morning call'd on Mr. G. at his own home, told him my business (which was to know if he would let me come into his counting-house to learn business) and after several minutes discourse he told me to call on him and he would let me know.	To-day saw Mr. Canfield, went with him and saw John P. Losey, with both of whom I had some interesting discourse.  Wrote a letter to Charles Russell.20 W.] Finished reading a small Hist. Amer. - changed it for Rob. Hist. of America.21 T.] Saw Mr. Losey again, discoursed with him de negotiis olim inserendis. - read the discovery of Amer. by Columbus.22 F.] Tended store all day - 9 at evening took a walk alone down to the Battery - return'd about 10.23 S.] Call'd. again on Mr. Gov. - had ill success.  This afternoon The Misses Whelpleys arrived, on their return from New England, they set out for Morris at 5 o'clock, I accompanied them to the ferry-house.24 Sunday] Went to meeting forenoon, sat in Mr. Robin's pew.- saw Phebe Denman, after meeting talked with her.  Afternoon went to see J. P. Losey - walked with him around the Battery.25 M.] Staid in the store - At evening Mr. Losey call'd on me et mihi dixit, ut ille mihi non juvet, in situatione nova [illegible].26 T.] Tended to the store.27 W.] Ditto--- Evening, went to see a fire in Broad street.28 T.] This morning about 4, was awaked by an alarm of fire.  Did not go to see it.  Finished reading Pizzario's conquest of Peru.29 F.] Staid in store.  At evening went to see Mr. Fitch - talk'd with him about keeping Bachelors' hall together.30 S.] To-day I mentioned my plan with Mr. Fitch, to Mr. Lewis and asked him to pay me what it cost him for my board.  He was unwilling, and gave some short and hard word - I retaliated and we kicked up quite a dust.  He told me to leave his store if not satisfied.  I told him I could find another as good as his in a very little time; and thus we broke our discourse, both in a pit.  After dinner I asked to let me go to the Library,- as I was going he told me he would consider on my proposition and we would say more on it - at evening we came upon the subject again.  He told me the inconvenience it would be to him.  I told him the benefits I expected to reap from it - We talked mildly and at last the storm blew over (tho' I lost my point) leaving only a few scattering clouds; but I am doubtful whether these few clouds do not again collect and bring another storm.1803 May1 Sunday] Went in the forenoon to Mrs. Dodge's - as I was going I call'd at a Barber's shop to get my hair cut where I saw Isaac Brittin an old playmate of mine (who is now a mason) whom I have not seen before in two or three years.	Aftn. went to Danl. Day's and in talking with him respecting my situation I told him I was not pleased, and wished to find a better place.  He mentioned to me Mr. Lovell's and that of Messrs. Van Gieson & Van Blansom - and agreed to find out whether they wanted or not.2 M.] Staid in the Store -- To-day saw Mr. Littell.3 T.] Tended the usual business of the Store.4 W.] Went, at evening to D. Day's to know what he had done for me.  Mrs. Day told me she had been to Messrs. V.G. & V.B.'s they could not give me a place in their store but would give me any assistance in their power - furthermore she told me that Mr. Lovell wanted - but wished to get a boy of 14 or 16.  Mr. Day came then with me to Mr. Lovell's.  I talked with Mr. Lovl. on the subject.  He said he wanted a boy to do the lower part of the business of the shop - such as sweeping carrying bundles &c &c, that if I came with him I must keep no company, must not absent myself from the shop without his leave and in fine must expect to work hard and live poor - must stay with him three years, for only my board and lodging.  I agreed to call the last of the week and let him know whether I could come on these terms.5 T.] Tended the store.  About this time Adolphus trying to get a place.6 F.] At evening called on Mr. Lovell - told him I would come with him, a few weeks on trial, on those terms.7 S.] This was a day of anxiety.  In order that I might not be turned off and be on expense, I had not yet told Mr. Lewis that I was determined on leaving him - but had agreed to come with Mr. Lovell unbeknown to him, depending merely on what he had formerly told me at three several times when a little angry - viz. that if I did not like my situation I was welcome to leave him at any time.  It now remained to introduce the business of my dissatisfaction to him, which had been silent ever since last Saturday - In order to do this as smoothly as possible I made choice of the time when Adolphus was at tea.  And as Adolphus was about agreeing to go to a place, which business he had made known in full to me (tho' I had not given him the least hint of my intentions) I introduced my business to Mr. Lewis, ut sequiter-	I asked him if Adolp. had yet agreed on going - he said he did not know.  I told him before Adolp. determined I wished to let him know that if he kept the same mind he had last Saturday that I would go instead of Adolphus.  He was a little confused t the unexpected news - and after a moments pause told me, that if I was determined on leaving him he had nothing to say against it.  But that he thought I had given up that idea.  I answered that he had frequently expressed a willingness that I should leave him if I could not be satisfied - that I was still not situated to my mind - that he had represented the inconvenience that would accrue to him, complying with my wishes - and that, consequently, I had determined on leaving him, whenever I could obtain his consent to the measure.  I further told Mr. Lewis I would leave him immediately, or if Adolphus had agreed to go, would stay with him a reasonable time for him to get other assistance.  He ask'd if I had another place in view.  I told him I had, and where the place was, but that I had made no certain agreement.  And after some further conversation he agreed to let me know in a short time how long I must yet continue with him.  In the evening he talked with Adolph. in my absence, and to my joy agreed with him to stay longer, and at 9 o'clock told me I might go as soon as I pleased.  He also was good enough to offer me the favor of staying with him till I made a bargain with some one else.8 Sunday] Aftn. went again to see Mr. Lovell - agreed to begin with him in the morning - staid at Mr. Lov. all night - at evening, happening at Captn. Greens, went with him to hear Mr. Murray the Preacher of Universal Religion - the house excessively crowded - heard better singing than ever I had before - ret. to Mr. Lovell's 9 o'clock.9 M.] After assisting in opening the store, went to Mr. Lewis' and assisted Adolph. in opening his; and having paid Mr. Lewis for a pair of Pantelloons which I had taken as part of my wages, I bid him a good morning and came to commence my apprenticeship with Mr. Lovell - was kept all day busy in the store.10 T.] This day we took $380.11 W.] Stephen Day & Gabrl.

River Church heard Johnny Robertson, who is now appointed on a circuit to Boston.  His text was in Job "Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace that thereby good may come unto thee.  He introduced the subject by attempting to prove that there had really been such a man as Job; which he no farther accomplished than merely to say that he believed it, and that as Paul mentions Job, and that as St. Paul lived so much nearer the time Job did, than we do, he certainly knew whether there was such a man, therefore (he contended) the fact is undoubted.  He handled the sermon entirely without system.  The New York Bakery burnt this evening.23 M.] Saw Charles Morrell,- Mr. Wood this day arrived in town.24 T.	}25 W.	} Kept close in the store - had plenty of business26 T.] This day the Soldiers called out, and the CORNER STONE of the new City hall laid, by the Mayor and Aldermen of the City.27 F.	} Usitata persecutus sum.

Sent a letter to Mr. Whelpley, and one to Levi.31 T.	}1803 June1 W.] To-day Henry Ford called to see me, as he was on his return to Yale College.  He gave me the character of Doct. Dwight, prest. of Yale,- a person profoundly learn'd, both in book, and experimental knowledge; fond of the Belles lettres paticularly, kind, affable and easy of access.2 T.	} Usitata persecutus sum -- Heard from home by Stiles Scudder.3 F.	}4 S. 	}5 Sunday] Morning read the Geography of European Turkey and Russia, in Payne's Geography.  Aftn. went with Ellis Potter, a shopmate, to the Universalist's Church in Magazine St. heard Mr. Palmer, whom I pronounce the completest master of gesticulation I ever saw in a pulpit.  From meeting went to see Fitch - talk'd with him on many things particularly Relgion - heard him express doubts of a future existence: i.e. such an existence that we shall be conscious of what we have gone thro' in this world.  Evening went to see Mr. Robins - was treated with not so much attention, apparently as usual.6 M.	} Tended strictly to the shop thro' the week, rose early and worked late, and experienced some gloomy hours.  Sometimes I think it the height of folly to sacrifice ease and pleasure so entirely to my prospect of gain, but when I reflect that it is necessary that I should do something to bring me a future support, my heart approves of my present employment, and stimulates me to exertion.7 T.	}8 W.	}9 T.	}10 F.	}11 S.	}12 Sunday] Rose at 6, took Payne's Geography and went to the Battery where I seated myself in one of the embrasures and read in the Geography of England till 8.

Friday evening went to the Battery to see Fire Works.22 W.	}23 T.	}24 F.	}25 S.] Set out at 7 by the way of Elizth. Town, for Morris - arrived at the point about 11, came with John Mahony in the stage.  Saw Miss C. Drake t Seely Canf.  Dined at Capt. Day's, Chatham, arrived in Town 7 o'clock - went a swimming with my acquaintance and about 9 came to Mr. Meeker's, where I staid all night.26 Sunday] Forenoon staid at Mr. Meeker's, heard of Mrs. who was there that Stephen Day had been awaken'd, under the preaching of Mr. Findley, and was warmly exercised in mind.  About three I set out with Mrs.-- in her chair, for Turkey; We had not proceeded more than a mile on our journey, when I perceived that Mrs. -- did not say as much as usual.  I spoke to her in order to raise some discourse, she merely answered me and was again silent.  I said nothing more for some considerable time but concluded she might be in some serious train of thoughts which it would not be proper for me to interrupt.  At length finding her so unusually still I could not but observe her more particularly, when I beheld that her eyes were shut, her arms lay as it were useless, not hold of her child, and her head droop'd as tho' in a fast sleep.  I spoke to her and asked her if she felt drowsy.  She started up, answered no - and said no more.  I again looked from her to guide the horse, but in less than one minute I observed her in the same condition as before.  I, very much surprised to see her, with whom I am so well acquainted, in such a situation, again addressed her, and asked her if she was well?  She again started up - answered yes - and was again silent.  I then observed her, and in a short time saw her falling into the same situation.  Quite astonished at these appearances, I earnestly entreated her to tell me if she felt well - assuring her that I thought something the matter, and that her child would fall out of the chair.  She look'd me full in the face, answerd. me, No, he won't - there's nothing the matter with me: And added no more.  Oculos glarane percepi, et ex hiatu, opinatus sum ut spirituosus liquores olerem.  About this time, passing a rough spot her child's head, as he lay on her lap, struck the side of the chair, which waked it from its sleep, and made it cry.  She tried to give it the breast, but appear'd unable to effect it.  This done, however, with difficulty, her hands soon ceased to hold the child, it fell from her breast to her lap, and she was fast sinking into her former stupid state, when I, fearing the child would fall to the ground, caught it, which roused her in some measure again from her reverie.	Thus she continued, stupifying and cheering alternately with not much alteration till we arrived at Turkey; her arms, as well as her tongue apparently almost useless, and herself unable to set steady in the chair, or to hold her child properly in her lap.	What may have been the cause of the appearances, is the question in my mind.  Had it been any other person in the world, beside herself, lequores id fuisse dicerem.  Were she weakly, Medicina aliquam speciem dicerem.	Full of anxiety and doubt, and not having enquired, or meaning to enquire what this cause may be, I leave it for time to disclose.	Arrived at Turkey about 7 o'clock - came to John Crane's on foot, where I stay'd all night.27 M.] Went in the morning with John to the Stoney-hill Medow. - ret. and wrote advertisements for a vendue to sell the grass.  Afternoon, set them up.  Went to the Levi Willcox's and to Doct. Elmer's.  Mrs. Elmer was unwell.28 T.] Looked over, and made some arrangements with the accounts of the Estate of our Mother.

Went to Ichabod Miller's after money for Mr. Lovell, got none - on my return call'd at Mr. D. Baker's and staid about an hour, two years yesterday since I was there before, got home about 2 o'clock.	At 4 went to see David Allen, who lately married had thereby forfeited 8 Bottles of Wine, agreeable to a former contract of ours.  Found him at home but got nothing better to drink than Spirits.  Came home before Night and went a fishing with Mulford - caught no fish.30 T.] In the forenoon put a pair of soals on my old shoes.  Aftn. Rode John's blk. Mare to Morris Tn.  Went thro' Bottle Hill, call'd at Wm. Brittin's and took Tex,- Went to Mr. Meeker's and turned out the Mare.

Aftn. attended my vendue (to sell Grass) in a South East-store.  Sold the Grass for £11 and 6s, gave seven pct. disct. for the Cash, which together with all other expenses in the business, reduced the Neat Amount to £8:19:1, which is (without one penny) the Interest of £128.- the 8 Acres of Land £10 [illegible] Acre.  The Grass, however, went very low, occasioned by the unfavorableness of the weather, which occasioned but few buyers,- seven only, attended the vendue.3 Sunday] Call'd in the morning, on Mr. Bailey - got the Cash for his Lot of Grass.  After breakfast started for Morris, call'd at S. Day's - recd. the Cash for his and A.D's lot.

Drake going to Doct. Jones'.  I went with them to the Doctr's. where I got acquainted with a Lieutenant Mulford of West Jersey, a recruiting Officer quartered in Morris.	In discoursing with Mulford on our Ancestry, we were not able to ascertain our relationship - we, however, came pretty near it.  He said that his Grandfather was one of two brothers, who first of any of the Mulfords, came from Long Island to Cape May; and I have heard my Grandfather say, that his Father was one of the first of the name, who came from the same to the same place, of course his Grandfather, and my Great Grandfather must have been the same person, or Brothers.	9 o'clock went and lodged with Wm. Beach.4 INDEPENDENCE.] Was waked soon after day break by the firing, and the ringing of the Bells.  Went to Mr. Meeker's to breakfast.  Aft. breakst. came to town with Mr. Wood.

Received a letter from, and wrote one to, Mr. Fitch.  Also wrote to Mr. Whelpley.15 F.	}16 S.	}17 Sunday] Morning finished Lavater.  This is the first Physiognomical treatise I ever read; and from what I here find, I cannot believe that Physiognomy can ever be reduced to a science, that will be generally useful.  True it is, indeed, that Genius, judgment, humor, wisdom, frankness, pusilanimity and the like qualities, do shew themselves in some measure in the countenances of those who posses them; but still, these appear in so many different forms, that I doubt very much whether rules can be given, which will direct the judgment of an observer, to determine on these internal qualities form external appearances, with sufficient accuracy to be useful.	Afternoon went with Ellis, to hear the celebrated Doctor Foster, the preacher of universal Religion.  He declared that honesty in our dealings, and friendship among our fellow-creatures, is all the Religion we are capable of having in this World, and that as we had no hand, before we came into this world, in preparing ourselves a situation here, so we can do nothing toward preparing one in that which is to come.  God acts with us arbitrarily, and will dispose of us in the other world, as he pleases.	Aft. Meeting wrote a letter to Henry Ford, now at Yale College.18 M.]	By John Mahony, recd. a letter from Mr. S.

His subject was drawing the distinction between the character of the righteous and wicked man; a subject not speculative enough to please me.  His voice was low and broken, his gestures few, and unadapted.  I was not entertained by the discourse.  The first time I ever heard him.	Aftn. went to the Baptish Meeting in Gold Street, aft. Meeting went to Capt. Green's and Mrs. Dodge's and to Mr. Williams' Meeting,- came home 11 o'clock.25 M.] Rec'd. a letter from Levi, requesting me to send him Blair's Lectures.26 T.	}27 W.	} Attended to my usual employment.28 T.] Bout. an abridgement of Blair's Lectures, on credit of Mr. Ezra Sergeant.

Crane and one to D. Allen.  At evening read considerable in Blair.31 Sunday] Finished reading Blair,- Afternoon walked with Ellis Potter up Greenwich beyond the state prison thence across to East River - I went to see Mr. Saml. Akerly, a brother-in-law of Doct. Mitchel.  He took me into his study - shewed me his collection of Metals & Minerals which indeed was a very large one.	This evening, having returned from my visit, I began to reflect on the particularly happy situation of him who wishes to acquire knowledge, and has sufficient resources to allow him to pursue it earnestly.  I regretted that I had not continued in study, since no other employment ever afforded me so much amusement, or was attended with so good success.  I was tempted to quit my present employment (tho' the idea of unsteadiness is disagreeable to me) and resume my study.1803 August1 M.] This afternoon saw Henry P. Russel - walked with him this evening on the Battery,- communicated to him some ideas I had had of getting an Education.  He recommended to me to fix, by all means on some object, at the same time tho't. it best to get an education if I wished to, and could conveniently.  Considerable talks of the Yellow Fever.2 T.] Sent by Henry, Blair's Lectures to Levi, with a letter.3 W.	}4 T.	} Tended to the business in the store.5 F.	}6 S.] The Mayor of the City reported in this day's paper that there has been 33 cases of Malignant Fever - 18 terminated in death, 8 in recovery, and the remainder were yet doubtful.	This has been to me a very unpleasant week.  My mind diverted from business, has been continually agitated with the Idea of getting an education.  And I am unable to determine what is best for me to do.  I have a good prospect for success in getting into business for myself, but still this business does not please me half as well as one would which is more connected with the sciences.  And should I, by the mercantile business acquire property (which is a very precarious supposition) sufficient to place me in a respectable situation, among my fellow citizens, I feel as tho' I could never enjoy myself, while inferior to them in point of knowledge.	On the other hand, my reasons for wishing an education are these; That if I wish to continue in the Mercantile business, I can transact it with more satisfaction to myself, as well as to better advantage; and should I never resume it, I fear not but that I can maintain myself by education, and am sure that I can take more satisfaction by education, in moderate circumstances, than in affluence clouded with ignorance.	Two material objections, however, to getting an education, present themselves, viz. lowness of circumstances and the disapprobation of relations.7 Sunday] Forenoon read part of the American Revolution.  Afternoon, wrote &c.  Evening went with Ellis and Mead to Thomas St. the centre of Whoredom.  We walked thro the street several times - sometimes together and sometimes separate.  One house appear'd to have most of the company.  There we saw many of our acquaintance and some we did not expect to see there.  We walked near the door, and sometimes would mix with the crowd as they entered and reentered, to keep from being distinguished.  Neither of us went in.- we return'd about 9 o'clock.8 M.] Staid in the store.  Alarming reports of the Fever.9 T.] Rec'd. a letter from Mr. Fitch.

Willcocks, who is at work in John's well, had a dispute concerning the end of the world.  Crane took what is written in the scriptures concerning it figuratively - Willcocks, litterally - Crane said that the earth would remain to eternity - that the burning as an oven, mention'd in the scriptures meant, not that the globe should be on fire, but that the Wrath of God should consume or do away with the wicked and their works, and establish on this globe the new Jerusalem - Willcocks said that the righteous would first be all caught up into heaven, than the wicked, and all their works together with the globe of earth, all the planetary system and all the stars should be burnt with fire, and entirely destroyed.18 T.] Finished my shoes - Went to Mr. Littell's and rec'd. of him fifty-five Dollars, a half year's rent.

Herald and notc'd that the reports of Thursday & Friday were 6 & 7 deaths,- this made me rather inclined not to go to N.York next Monday, as I had before determin'd, having been sent for by Mr. Lovell.  Saw in the Herald, the Pres. Message to Congress bearing date 17th Oct. inst. wherein was strongly recommended the purchase of Louisiana, together with some territory belonging to the Kaskaskia tribe of Indians; to which a statement of the public funds was subjoin'd.  Came to Mr. Meeker's 7 o'clock with Tucker - found there Miss P. Denman, Miss Green, Messrs Russell, and Monsr. Lambert.	This evening Mr. Wood brot. word that the Public Treasury at Trenton had been robb'd of $10 Thous., that it was robb'd. by four men who came armed to the treasurer, a few nights ago,- call'd him up - threaten'd him with immediate death if he made any resistance to them or made any noise; and that after having bound and gagg'd him three of them stood over him with presented pistols, while the other got the treasure in readiness to carry off.	After our Company dispersed, Mr. Wood & I fell into conversation concerning Levi's living with Mr. Canfield; on which subject we have had conversation before.  We also discoursed on my pursuing an education.  On this, I told him that from the best calculation I could make, I should want to borrow about $400 if I could not sell my property - he told me he thot. Mr. Canf. would lend me the money.  I concluded to go and see Mr. Canf. to-morrow afternoon,- went to bed about 12.23 Sunday] Went to Doct. Canf's. before breakfast - when I got there they had just finish'd theirs - thus I got no breakfast.  Went to work at the books - finished them about 12 o'clock - took dinner with the Doct. and before we rose from the table he paid me 20/5 for my services at his books.  Went to church afternoon heard Doct. Saml. Smith, Prest. of Princeton College.  His discourse was chiefly a narration of the history of Abraham - in it he mentions the destruc. of Sod. & Gom. and particularizes on Lot's Wife being turned into a pillar of Salt.  Sic fatus est.  The reality of Lot's wife's turning into a pillar of salt, some have question'd, and have offer'd criticisms on the expression; and perhaps the translation of it would have been more correct, had it been express'd thus "She was turned in a statue dumb and immoveable, like a pillar of Salt."  That this was the case there is no room to doubt, for history affords many instances of people's being caught by the steem of subterraneous fires, by which their juices were so soon evaporated or destroyed that they became immediately lifeless statues, and fasten'd to the spots on which they were caught.  And passing over many instances I will cite only one taken from the Ancient History of the Gauls.  "At a certain time in the uncivilized ages of the Gauls - when each tribe herded the flocks [illegible] The women of one of their tribes went out at eveng. to milk their flock; when suddenly the vitrifying steem of a volcano which made an eruption near them, pervaded their limbs, and they were all fix'd, motionless, and lifeless statues to the spot in which each had placed herself."  From this he descended to the sacrificing of Isaac by his father, who was arrested in the act by the voice of an Angel;- and expiated on this act's being typographical of the coming of Christ.	After meeting call'd on Mr. Canfield, at his house,- told him I calculated on going to N. York in the morning - and that I had a little business I wished him to attend to if he was at leisure.  We went into the counting room.  I mentioned Levi's coming to live with him - he said James had spoken to him on the subject, that he would take him - but had not made up his mind as respects the terms he should come on.  He said that as it was not every boy who fancied the business Levi might come, that he would observe how it pleased him, and in the course of a short time would propose the terms on which he would take him.	I then told Mr. Canfield I had another piece of business to lay before him, which was this: That for various reasons I had lately determined to complete an Education if possible, that in order to do this I should want to borrow $400 for which I would offer land security - that I would know if he could not oblige me with this sum.  He replied that this season he had been pinched for money to meet his own engagements, but that he had a prospect of more money next year, as he was about selling lands and had debts due him which he expected would be settled; that if he could spare the money when I wanted it he would let me have it on the terms I proposed; but that he could not give me any certain promise of assistance.  4 o'clock I came home - told Mr. Wood my conversation with Mr. Canfield.  Mr. Wood said he thot. there was no doubt but that I could get money enough, should Mr. Canfield not see fit let me have any - that he would himself assist me to 100 Dolls. next fall.  I here thought of the money belonging to Levi, now in Mr. Meeker's which must be nearly 150 Dolls. which if I can borrow I can nearly make out without farther assistance.	Vespera abeunte, factum est, quod non mihi expectatus fuit.

When we were about starting, I got into the stage and should have come away without paying for my dinner had not Rolf ask'd me for it.  He did it thus.  'There's one man I believe has not paid me for his dinner.'  I was at that moment looking at the town Clock;- he spoke low & tho' I heard him distinctly, yet so wholly aws my mind engaged in noticing the time of day, that I did not think of its being me whom he address'd.  But observing a silence after he had spoken I looked around to see who it was that had so much dishonesty as to wish to get off without paying the Landlord, when, behold! the eyes of the company, were all placed on me.  I blush'd.- was angry with myself - handed him the money in haste, excusing myself as well as I could.  He pardon'd me freely, saying that it was his own business to see that he got his own, and that he was never bashful on such occasions.29 S.] Rose at Sunrise after my arrival last night at 7.

Mrs. Dodge's eldest Son, who has been from home ever since 1789.  He sail'd in that Year from New York in an India-bound Ship - was sold by his Captn. in India to a British Man of War, where he remain'd till about a year ago.31 M.] Tended to business in the store.

Mr. Lovell not yet able to attend to business.5 S.	}6 Sunday] Rainy day.  Staid at home and wrote a letter to Wm. Whelpley.  Read some in Horace, and in Paine's Geography.  Evening went to Captn. Green's, saw the Captn. himself who arriv'd yesterday from S[illegible[.	Went to Universal Meeting with E. Potter, heard Palmer, his text was in the 90th Psalm; 'Teach us to number our days that thus we may apply our hearts unto Wisdom.'  He divided his discourse into two heads, viz. 'What is it to number our days?' and 'How may we, they being number'd, apply our hearts thereby unto wisdom?'	In explaining how we should number our days, he follow'd this method.  He first notic'd how much of our time was taken up in sleep,- then how much in dressing and undressing - how much in idle, unprofitable conversation and company - how much was left unemploy'd, i.e.pass'd over without exercise of the body, and in a relax'd state of mind, in which we neither commit crimes nor do anything profitable - how much taken up in adversity, when the mind, not left free to any profitable pursuit, has enough to do to groan under its burthen of afflictions.  And after he had enumerated several more portiosn of our time which pass'd unprofitably, he deducted the small portion in which we may be said really to live, and be capable of enjoying and profiting ourselves.	'The portion of our time,' says he, 'in which we may (strictly speaking) be said really to live, is truly very small.  For while we are dead, except that we retain the power of returning to life.  Our bodies are become motionless; and our minds, tho' not inactive, are incapable of pursuing any object, or profiting themselves in the least.  While in idle company we are dead - dead to our welfare, either in this or a future world.  While in our hours of careless sport, we are dead - we neigher profit our bodies nor minds.  And while in adversity we are even worse than dead, for then we are fully employed in bearing the keen pangs of anguish that rankle in our souls.  We then really live, and then only, when we are capable of profiting our immortal part!'	After expiating on these and many other ideas, he spoke in the second place to this effect.	Since we have so little time left in which we really live, how much does it become us as candidates for a future states to apply our hearts, in that small space, unto wisdom?  And this is alone the seeking our future welfar.  For it is a fact, dictated by nature, that "Man wants but little here below, nor wants that little long."  The life of man is but a moment compar'd with his eternal existance.  Some have compar'd it to an arrow shot from a bow, which passes swiftly away to its mark.  Others have compar'd it to the reading of a history.  On one page you read the mighty atchievements of some hero, his courage, his virtue, turn to the next page, your former hero is gone,- you have anew, anotehr hero, another king, other wars engage your attention.  So the life of man, a little time ago such a man was famous.  Where is he now?  His place is fill'd by another, who will soon leave the stage of action to an unknown successor.  But lastly, people have computed in round numbers that 730 Millions of souls exist on the earth, of whom 350 die every hour, that is one every second of time!  This moment, one of our fellow mortals has pass'd off to eternity! another! another! and how soon will that moment come which will carry us off also?7 M.] Tended in the Store.  A Cold day.

Evening told Mr. Lovell my intention of going to Morris - he appear'd unwilling I should go - was in some measure angry - and said he would not consent to it by any means till the business was over - that is, not under six weeks or two months,- I told him I had thot. of going this week or next - he said he would not agree to it at all - that I ought at least to give him three months notice.  I told him that was not in our agreement, which was that I should leave him when I got dissatisfied with staying.  And after having upbraided me with my instability and indeterminateness in my objects, he left me, without giving me farther satisfaction, and went to bed.17 T.	} Had business plenty in the Store.

Friday evening got my vests of Mrs. Dodge, paid her 11/ for making them.18 F.	}19 S.	}20 Sunday] Went in the morning on board the vessel in which Mr. Fitch is to sail - did not see him - he sails to-morrow.  call'd at Mr. Robins' before meeting.  Staid home forenoon - aftn. went to the French Church, heard Mr. Barry.  6 o'clock went to hear Palmer, the Deist.  (This the first time I ever heard Deistical doctrine preach'd.)  The assertion, from which he made his discourse, was to this effect; "That the Christian religion embraces principles which are obnoxious to moral virtue."	He made a long introduction in order to shew the right every man had, to examine, and compare with reason, that religion or point of religion, which his parents had taught him.  When he came to the point, the only idea which seem'd to make at all for his assertion was the following;- "That when people were possess'd with the Idea, that Christ by his merits had taken away the sins of the world they would neglect to seek their salvation for themselves, and would depend on him, neglecting among other principles of their religion, moral virtue, which is the great source of human happiness."  "For", says he, "Let a man have some one to depend on for a living, and he'll always be a worthless fellow - he'll be a blank, or worse than a blank in society.-but turn him off, and tell him to shirk for himself and ten to one but he makes a respectable man.	After meeting I went with Mead & Ellis, up town;- ad Thos. St. veniebamus - ad domum, qua pellices vivebant.- per fenestram videbamus jacentes in torum virum et mulierem.- illi surgebant, mulier irata visa est.  Tandem vir, cumilla negotiare incepit, illi numum tulit.-  Tum illo, nummo recepto, recumbit resupina in too, et se pro [illegible] parat.- ille se vestem exuit, et, lumine non extincto, illius petit amplexum.  Alba genua mulieris extendenta super viri tergum, vidimus - vidimus motus viri, et illius gaudia.- postqual ille fuerat in acto Veneris nihilominus quartam horae vilus puer fenestram fergit, et illum deturbavit.  We then departed in haste from the temple of Venus, and came home.21 M.] Mr. Fitch call'd on me toward evening.- agreed to see him to-morrow morning.22 T.] Went before breakfast to see Mr. Fitch on board the vessel - at 1/2 past 8 bid him farewell, and came home.  He sail'd about 4 this afternoon.23 W.	} Tend'd to the usual business in the store.  Wednesday evening spoke again to Mr. Lovell concerning my going away.- he was in a better humor now than before, and said he only wished me to stay till the hurry of the business was a little over.  I agreed to stay three weeks from Saturday.  Friday evening went to the play - saw performed 'The Glory of Columbia' and 'Lock and Key'.24 T.	}25 F.	}26 S.] At evening saw Jacob Ogden - took a walk with him to Mr. Kent's saw Robt. Russell who lives there.27 Sunday] Forenoon went to Johnst. meeting - aftn. to Universal.  Evening to hear Palmer.  The passage Palmer discours'd from, was to this effect.  But the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, when the heavens shall pass away and the Elements be dissolved with fervent [illegible]  He agreed that the world would never be destroy'd.  'For,' says he, 'according to the late and approved system of Astronomy, the globe or world in which we live, is nothing different in its nature from the planets, that is, it is probable they are inhabited, and are worlds to a race of beings similar to ourselves, the stars are of the nature of our Sun, and surrounded by planets which are also inhabited,- filling the immensity of space with an infinite numbers of worlds, all govern'd by uniform and perfect laws, and kept in motion in the most perfect harmony;- Now I will ask, can any one bring an instance of its being recorded, even from the earliest ages, of any of these worlds being destroy'd?  Do not all that we ever saw or heard of, yet remain, and preserve their periodical motions in the nicest punctuality?  And sure if the Almighty created these to be destroy'd, it is probable we should have seen some of them disappear before this day.'	'Furthermore, The world will not be destroy'd because it is composed of matter that cannot be annihilated - but it will be said that nothing is impossible with the Almight,- I ask, Can the Almighty annihilate his own existence?  What is in its own nature an impossibility, must be impossible with God.'	'The text, also,' says he, 'is unphilosophic and inconsistent, - 'tis said, "the heavens shall pass away"- but where will they go to?  They are now in the infinite regions of space, and would still be in it, tho' they should shift their situation.'  And, "The Elements shall be dissolved with fervent heat."  'The earth, air, fire and water are to be dissolved with fervent heat!'  What!  Is fire to be dissolved with fervent heat?  And water, which is already in the highest possible state of solution, is this to be dissolved with fervent heat?  Mere nonsense! and inconsistent scribbling!!	'But, in objection to these natural impossibilities, it may be said that the Almighty could at pleasure remove them, by resolving the very natures themselves, from which the impossibilities arise - for has not he, inasmuch as he has created worlds and beings, also created their natures, and whatever pertains to them.  And would it not be detracting from the power of the Almighty to say that he had done a thing which he could not at pleasure undo?  In answer to this, I will ask if it would not detract infinitely more from him, as respects his wisdom, and unchangeableness, to say that he would at one time do a thing that at another he would dissapprove of; and should make a world and fill it with intelligent beings,- and because as he found it not to answer the purpose for which he intended it, (for he knew not what kind of a thing it would be) should at length tear it to pieces?  In my opinion it is in the highest degree unworthy the Supreme Creator and Preserver of the Universe, to say that the infinity of worlds which are his work, and under his government, are not created, on principles, and govern'd by laws as unchangeable, and eternal as himself.'28 M.] Mr. Wood came to town.  Spent the evening with him at White Hall.29 T.	} Tended closely to business in the Store.  Wednesday evening went to Van Alan & Harvey's book auction- bot. Fenn's Algebra for 3/- and a ream of foolscap paper for 14/6.1803 December1 T.] All day in the store.  Eveningw ent with Mr. Wood to Captn. Green's.2 F.	} Friday evening bor'd. $5. of Mr. Wood.  Saturday evening bot. a Greek grammar for 6/ - and of E. Sargeant & Co 5 hundred dutch Quills for 12/- Saml. Muchmore & his wife call'd to see me.3 S.	}4 Sunday] Staid home forenoon and read some in Fenn's Algebra.5 M.	} Tended to the usual business of the Store.  Monday sent my trunk up to Morris by Saml. Muchmore.6 T.	}7 W.] Toward evening agreed with Potter to go with him to the play.  As we were about to set out, Mr. Whelpley call'd to see me.  Potter went on.  After some time Mr. Whelpley ask'd me to take a walk with him.  When we had got out he told me he was under a strong temptation to go to the Theatre, but was not determined with respect to the propriety of it.  He said as to his own conscience, he had no doubts, and was perfectly willing to go, but he did not know what effect it might have among his acquaintance, and and connections in his profession.  I told him I was just about starting to go to the Theatre when he came in, and should be happy in his company if he would go.  He said he tho't. it proper for him to go, inasmuch as he superintended speaking at home, in order to see the proper manner of speaking and performing.  He at length determin'd to go.  We saw perform'd 'The CASTLE SPECTRE', and 'The VILLAGE LAWYER'.8 T.] Evening went with Mr. Whelpley up to Mrs. Akerley's, saw a Specimen of the Salt said to be found in Louisiana, on the Missouri about 1000 miles from its mouth,- also a Specimen of Plaster of Paris found in Lou'a.- both of which Doct. Mitchel had sent home from the Seat of Governt.  Saw a letter of the Doct's. stating the bounds of Louis'a. as ceded to the U. States, viz. Beginning at the mouth of a small river, a little west of Pensicola,- following it to its source, thence in a northern direction to the 31st Degree of N. Latitude, thence along this line to the Mississippi, thence up G. River to its source, near or at the Lake of the woods, thence a small distance a N.W.ly direction - thence southerly along the Northern Andes, (or a large Ridge of mountains which appear to be a continuation of the Andes) to the Gulph of Mexico; embosoming all the large rivers that empty themselves into the Mississippi from the west.	Leaving Mrs. Akerly's, went to the Museum, where we staid till after 10 - and among many other curiosities, saw the famous Venus de Medicis, of polish'd Marble, wrot. out of one entire piece.9 F.] Spent the evening again with Mr. Whelpley in the Museum, went this evening into the Academy of Arts and Sciences kept in the Rotunda, formerly Ricket's Circus,-Among the many Busts and Statues we saw here, which were of Plaster of Paris, we saw a bust of Demosthenes, one of Romulus, and the family of Niobe.  A statue of Venus de Medicis, as large as life, the Group of Laocoon, Castor and Pollux, and what exceeded all, Apollo Belvidere, eight feet high, a perfect model of beauty and proportion of parts in the male species.  He stood as just having shot an arrow,- his bow was in his left hand which was extended,- his right hand hung easily by his side, as having just let go of the bow string, and his head was turn'd to the left to see the Arrow fly.  We return'd about half past 9.  Talk with Mr. Lovell about coming to Morris to-morrow.  He gave his consent, I prepar'd to come.	Thus ends my apprenticeship at the mercantile business, having been in it between 8 & 9 months.10 S.] Set out 8 o'clock - as I was coming away, Mr. Lovell gave me $2. to bear my expenses.  I took the money, and as I came down B.Way bought Kent's Lucian of Mr. Caritat,- this book is all I have for my 9 mos. services in the Mercantile business.	Came by E. Town,- the Stage upset in Bottle Hill - 6 in it, and none hurt - arrived at Mr. Whelpley's 7 o'clock.11 Sunday] Went to Church - aftn. meeting to Mr. Meeker's, from there, on Mr. Wood's horse to S. Muchmore's - ret'd. to Mr. Whelpley's at 7 at night.12 M.] Went to School - recommend'd my Greek Studies - enter'd the Testament Class in the 2nd Chapter of Matthew and began the Grammar.	As I have now made a total change in my employment and prospects, it may not be improper, perhaps, to state here some of the motives which have prompted me to this measure.  From my earliest youth, as near as I can recollect, I was very fond of reading, and was always able to commit to memory with a degree of facility.  When I was about 10 years old I went to School in Turkey to a teacher, Mr. Hector Smith, whose custom it was to have his scholars learn the Catechism.  At a particular day it was notified that Mr. Elmer, our parish Priest would come to hear us recite it.  He came on the day appointed - I was placed at the head of the whole School,- I recited my answers in turn, as far as the rest knew, which was about to the commandments, - from there every question was given to me, and I gave every answer correctly to the end;- and for my exertion and superior merit my teacher presented me with a New Primmer, which I have to this day unsullied, and which I intend to keep as a memorial of my former ambition in Study.	At my mother's death, which was the dissolution of our family, I came to Morris Town (as may be seen by reference to my memorandum for that time) and enter'd the School.  In the pursuit of Study I found myself as well pleas'd as in my younger days, the more I studied, the better I liked it.  But thinking my circumstances too low to afford me a liberal education, I at length resolved on going to business - accordingly went.  There, I found myself surrounded by new objects, and an entirely new employment presented itself.  In fact I felt myself another person from what I formerly was - but not the person I wish'd to be!  I had nothing to do there with the Sacking of Troy - with Eneas' gazes on his father's grave, or his Tuscan battles,- Ovid told me none of his stories - of Pyramus and Thisbe, or Ceres' search for Proserpine,- Horace did not come sing to me his noble master, Macenas;- but, instead of these, 'Your cloth is too [illegible].'  'Your Linen is too highly starch'd, and will prove rotten'.  'If I can't suit myself better I'll call again.'- was the chief music I hear'd.  And to put up goods, that the counters might be clear to shew more, which I must (Sisyphus-like) put up again, was my principal employment thro' the week.  On Sunday I had my choice, of walking to church alone, or with a parcel of merchant's boys, who, illiterate, unphilosophical, and for the most part void of decency, would fill the streets with their sneers and idle conversation;- I generally chose the former.	I pass'd some time in this way without knowing why it was that I found myself so degraded in my own eyes, as I appear'd to be.  At length I perceived that I did nothing, thro' the day, out of choice, my employment was disagreeable to me too, and it was merely to make myself appear decent, and to shun the appellation of lazy, that I would wait on a customer when he came in.   I reflected frequently on my situation,- in fact my mind, the chief of the day, instead of being confin'd to my business, was in contemplation of a prospect of future life.  I recollected the Maxim of Lord Chesterfield, 'In order to be successful in life, a person should make choice of a profession pleasing to him.'- and to look forward to the time when I should be in business for myself I saw no better times, I should still have the same employment and as little to do with science - I concluded this would not do!  But, on the other hand, I was sensible of the effect a sudden and total change in employment, would have among a certain part of my acquaintance, I mean that part, who, void of science, think the best employment in this world, is the accumulation of property.  This was for some time a stimulus to me to forget what little I knew of the beauties of science, and try to make myself better pleased in my business.  I wholly renounc'd reading - mingled in the company of my fellow clerks, and made myself one in their conversation and walks.  But what effect had this.  Instead of familiarising myself to such a mode of living I found myself more and more averse to it, and had it been accompanied with the idea of eternal duration, I had ere long been almost willing to change situations with Sisyphus, or even Tantalus himself!	I was soon brot to reconsider my situation.  I was well convinced I could not make myself a man of great business, for the more I got acquainted with such characters the less I envied their situations.  I recollected my former fondness for science, and felt as tho' I would prefer a life of confinement, secluded from every human voice, had I but the priviledge of such books as I could wish;- toa  life of business and noise.  I knew that to return to study, tho' a change in employment, would not be a change in my mind; for study was always my delight, and nothing turn'd me from it but a scantiness of the means of pursuing it.  Want of money, still remain'd as an obstacle to my inclination.  I consider'd, however, that an education when once obtain'd would accompany me thro' life,- and that while it was sure to afford means of a respectable livelihood, it was also a foundation from which wealth and greatness were most likely to flow.  I resolv'd to make my thots. known to some of my friends - accordingly I did, and obtain'd the promise of assistance if I should find it necessary to ask it.	Thus have I renounced business for an employment better suited to my inclination, and one in which I think I am more likely to succeed.13 T.	} Tended to the School.14 W.	}15 T.] Went to School.

Q. Are Theatrical amusements beneficial to Society?  I was on the negative.  I divided my address, and spoke from these three heads - viz. 1st Of the tendency plays have to draw people from their business.  2nd Of the Advantage, if any, which may be derived from plays.  3rd To What kind of minds this advantage can arise, and in what effect it can have on Society.  The Question was decided in the negative.23 F.] Rose, 6 o'clock.  Studied my Testament lesson, viz. from the 5th verse of the V Chapter of Matthew, to the 15th.

Return'd 10 o'clock and finish'd my translation.31 S.] Revised and corrected my translation - began to transcribe it.  A stormy day - work'd all day at my translation.	Thus ends 1803.  At the commencement of this year I was at Mrs. Wetmore's tending.  I have made very little progress in science since,- the most of my time having been taken up in merchandizing.	But, Should providence continue kind,	And guard my life, I'll feast my mind;	Nor from the path of Science stray,	Where pinks and roses strew the way.
