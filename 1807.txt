1807 JanuaryOn this first day of January I am worth about $800, not more,- it is in two bonds with a mortgage, against John Scheruman.  The bonds are on interest and payable one next May, the other the May following.  I board with Israel Canfield in Morristown, and am studying Law with Sylvester D. Russell Esqr.  I lodge with Levi, in the counting room of Mr. C's. new store house.  My present intention is to stay in my present situation till May when I shall receive one of my bonds.  What I shall do after that I cannot tell.  I may go back to Connecticut, either to Mr. Daggett's or to Litchfield; I may be determined to remain and finish my studies in this town.  There is also some small prospect of my going to the southward next fall, information which I expect soon from Fitch will determine that point.  On the whole my present prospect of settlement in life is bad, I know not where I shall go even to finish my studies, the only determination which I have fully made is to pursue the study of the law with as much assiduity as my health will permit, in whatever place my interest may lead or fix me.1 T.] Today I wrote from memory about half of Blackstone's 5 Chap.

Had some conversation with Gen. Doughty respecting Crittenden.  He thinks as Mr. Richards.  Went with Mr. Richards to N.Vernon to see Mr. Hopkins, was not pleas'd, with his first appearance.  Made no bargain with him but invited him to town to-morrow evening. On my return about 3 o.clock, found Atwood a young fellow of my class, here to see me. He has been teaching at N.Y. since Commencement.15 T.] I attended, this forenoon, the examination in the Academy.  Afternoon, made arrangements for beginning school to-morrow.  Even'g. I made a contract with the Directors at Mr. Richard's.  Hopkins was there.  We parted with these ideas.  If I conclude to hire him, I send him word, and in a fortnight from the rec't. of it he comes. After I ret'd. I agreed with Atwood to go into the Academy a few days.  Look'd a little at Tacitus.  Procured board for Atwood at Mrs. Israel Russell's.16 F.] At 9, I began my SCHOOL; had 22 scholars in the Languages, 5 In English.  Atwood taught for me in the other room, he had 26 in all.  Did very little in the evening. Atwood went to Mrs. Russell's to dine.17 S.] Taught in the forenoon. Aftn. examined what repairs were necessary to the Academy.  Read Tacitus this evening.18 Sunday] Read a little in Tacitus.  Spent the afternoon in part at Dr. Pierson's.  Spent the evening there in company with Atwood & Cruttenden.  Said something to Cruttenden about assisting me for a year; for after all that has been said against Cruttenden by certain individuals, it is the general opinion that he is the best teacher for that room, that can now be had.19 M.] Taught. Atwood in the other room. Evening bargained with Cruttenden.  I am to allow him 2/7 of the whole revenue of the Academy. He is to take into his room all who do not study either Languages, Geography or Mathematics.20 T.] Cruttenden went again to teaching. Atwood assisted me in my room.  Spent the evening playing whist in the house with At. Mr. C & Dr. C.21 W.] Taught, Atwood in my room Cruttenden in the other. Evening read some in Tacitus de mor. Ger.  Rec'd. a Catalogue of the Students in Yale, sent me by Wm. Whelpley.22 T.] Taught school. Today Atwood left town, on foot, for N. York.23 F.] Taught.

To-day arrived a pair of new globes and 5 maps, for the Academy, bought by Mr. Richards in N. York. The maps are one of the World, one of Europe one of Africa, one of Asia and one of America.  Evening read some in Cicero for Milo.25 Sunday] Not very well. Doct. Wm. Campfield spent some part of the day at my office. I read in Cicero pro Milone usque ad perorationem.  In the evening I went over to Mr. Whelpley's and was there introduced to His honor Judge Livingstone.  The judge was there to see his son Clermont who is a member of Mr. W's. select school. Judge Livingstone is above the middle stature but is slender built. From his mouth upwards his physiognomy resembles that of Cicero; His chin projects. His eye is dark, and tho' not penetrating is expressive: much placid wisdom seems to rest on his whole countenance.  His language at well as dress is plain.  He conversed fluently but in terms which a child can comprehend.  The Greek he says he has lost, but the Latin and French he glories in, the latter he speaks with much ease.  To me, and even to Mr. Whelpley he seems well informed on almost all subjects.  The whole field of science he seems to survey with facility.  While I was there, his conversation was first on school keeping next on language and then on politics.  On the whole he appears to be a gentleman of quite superior genius and thoroughly read in all polite literature and is in all probability well qualified for his late appointment of U.S. Judge for the Northern district: vice Patterson deceased.26 W.] Taught.  Evening unwell, much oppress'd at the lungs by the present extreme cold weather, play'd a few games of backgammon with Mrs. C.27 T.] Taught.  Evening read the play called the distress'd Mother.  This play is by Ambrose Philips, and is found on the story of Pyrrus and Andromache, to be found in Virgil's 2d Eneid.  The language is very low and I think the play no great thing.  It is very barren of incident & interest.28 W.] Taught.  Chas. Esty supplied the place of Cruttenden who was sick.  At noon rode to Mr. Meeker's - dined there.  Evening rec'd. a letter from Wm. Whelpley.  Mr. Canf'd. rec'd. from Gen'l. Holmes now in Congress, the late message of the Pres't. containing all information which had come to his knowledge respecting "BURR'S CONSPIRACY".  I read the two first acts of J. Caesar.29 T.] Taught.  Evening wrote a letter to Wm. Whelpley.  Took from the library 1 Vol. Ancient Europe.  Read more in the tragedy of Caesar.30 F.] Taught.

Finished reading Tacitus de mor. Germanorum.16 M.] Taught.  Evening read in company with Charles Estey the comedy written by Kotzebue called "Speed the plough."  This is certainly a play of much merit, perfectly chaste & very comic in many of its parts.17 T.	} This week I taught as usual.  Returned 1st Russell & got 2.. We concluded to play "Speed the plough" - the principal parts are thus distributed.  Farmer Ashfield Chas. Estey.- Sir Abel Handy, myself.- Bob Handy, Melancton Whelpley &c.

On Thursday evening of this week, I received 50 copies of Pindaric ode, from the hands of Mr. Day who printed it.  This ode I call "The Ale Fair, or Reynard's decease."  Day printed it for $2.  When he brought it to Mr. Cruttenden who engaged him to print it I happened to be at Mr. Whelpley's. C. Estey was also present.  Charles was let into the secret of my being the author, and of our intentions.  Chas. & Crutten'n. therefore took a number of the copies and scattered them about town, at the door of every man of taste.  Next day the thing was briskly circulated and talked of.  The opinion was that Mr. Whelpley was the author.  This opinion arose from the circumstance of some of Mr. W's. boys obtaining from Day some copies of the Ode and offering them for sale.11 W.	}12 T.	}13 F.	}14 S.	}15 Sunday] Attended meeting and read in Gillies' Greece.16 M.] Taught.  Read in the third volume of Gillies' Greece.17 T.] Taught.  The session of the Supreme Court this day commenced in town.  I spent a little time at the C.House & read in Gillies.18 W.] Taught.  Evening I spent sometime after school hearing the Farce rehearsed.  About 7 I came home and read, in Gillies, a part of the reign of Philip of Macedon.       Though I have often heard the character of this prince in general terms, I never paid much attention to those particular traits by which he is manifestly distinguished from most other men, till now.  Philip's power rose from a very small beginning; and was credited not so much by a fortunate combination of circumstances, as by his own irresistable energies of mind.  He possess'd not only courage to execute, but genius to plan: and to plan in so nice a manner that the execution was generally certain and highly advantageous.  He could anticipate the event of almost any cluster of circumstances by which he was surrounded; hence, his skill extended into every kind of base intrigue & deceitful injustice, could direct all Greece in furtherance of his own aggrandizement.  For selfish policy, impenetrable deceit, & a total disregard to justice, he is squalled by no man, whose character I have any knowledge of, so completely as by Buonaparte.19 T.] Taught.  This morning I rose about 7; went to the Academy and opened it, returned, and breakfasted a quarter past 8.  At 9, I went to school.  My first business after I got there was to hear the 3rd Latin gram. class, a class of three, who are the laziest boys in school.  After them came the 2d L. gram. class containing 13, six or seven of whom are smart, the rest gradually declining almost to the capacity of a brute.  They recited the chapter of Adjectives.  Third class contains 5, all considerable geniuses; 3 very good.  To them succeeded the Greek grammar class which has four in it, one good and three respectable geniuses.  They recited the beginning of verbs in mi.  After them came the English grammar, a class of 9 mostly very smart.  Their lesson was the 14 cast rules of Murray's Syntax.  The introduction class came next, composed of three, and recited the under the rule respecting adjectives governing the dative.  The morning lessons, or those recitations which are prepared out of school being thus ended, my attention was next turned to the reading class, which includes a majority, of the school.  They read in the Compend, in the Persian expedition of Alexander.  The forenoon exercises closed with the Geography recitation, on Scotland.  (The Map of Europe to-day was brought to ye. Acad.)       The afternoon school opened at 1/2 past 1, and the recitations were in the following order.  Horace, Virgil, Nepos, Eutropius, 2d do. Eng. parsing, 3d Lat. gram.  School dismiss'd 1/2 past 4 when 1 attended a rehearsal of the Farce till 6.  Evening, read in Gillies.20 F.] Taught.  Spent the evening at G.H. Ford's in a circle of young Ladies of no small degree of splendor, and possessing attractions not to be despised.  In the first place Eliza F. daughter of Gabriel Esqr. was tippd. off in manner at once elegant tho' plain.  This young Miss is just coming into company.  She affects the accomplished lady, but cannot wholly stifle her natural bent of disposition, which is to shew her cunning in playing the coquette.  Julia Ann Phoenix, daughter of Maj'. Dan'l. was among the rest.  Her I take to be the belle of Morristown, if good sense & modesty belong to that character.  She is perhaps 16, and will, if I am not deceived, make a worthy woman.  Several others of lees importance (at least in my eye) were present, for instance, Old Mother Tuttle's sorrel Colt, Pigmy King, Moreau's battering ram &c,&c.  The gentlemen were P. Phoenix, Iac. King, John OHara &c.  This is the first time I over saw this young set collected; and the first time I have been in a party since I left N. Haven.21 S.] Taught in the forenoon. Aftn. we rehearsed the comedy.22 Sunday] Today I read the expedition of Alexander the great, in Gilles, from his leaving Macedon, to his death in Babylon.  This historian allows him few or no weaknesses till after the death of Hepheiston his beloved friend; when to drown the melancholy into which he had unavoidably sunk, he had recourse to wine & merriment, which shortened his own days.23 M.] Taught.  Evening made out accounts of tuition for the present quarter ending weak after next.24 T.] Taught.  In the evening I finished making out my accounts for tuition; and read some in the third vol. of Gil. Greece.25 W.] Taught.  Evening read.  Heard the Comedy rehearsed, aft. school.26 T.] Taught.  After school the Farce was rehearsed.  Finished reading the History of Greece.27 F.] Taught.  This evening I went to a Ball at Freeman's.  P.Phoenix, C. Shaver & C. Freeman were managers.  It was but a small assembly, collected from this town only.  There were present fourteen ladies & about nineteen gentlemen; such as they were.  1 staid till 1/2 past 1 - bill 14/.28 S.] Taught Forenoon.  Afternoon, rehearsed the Comedy.  Evening, read and nodded about two hours, then went to bed.29 Sunday] Staid at home all day and did very little.  Read the article of Grecian History in Kett's Lectures.30 M.] Taught.

It has snowed all day: the snow is 6 or 7 inches deep.1807 April1 W.] Rose late.  Before school I ret'd. Gillies to the lib'y. and took 1st Gibbon.  Taught.  Walked home from school at noon on the crust, which bore me all over the green.  Evening we rehearsed 2 acts of the Comedy & I read the first Chap. of Gibbon's Dec. & Fall of Roman Em.2 T.] Taught.  Today the storm recommenced.  It snowed, it hailed, it rained.  After school we rehearsed the 3 remaining acts of the Comedy.  In the evening I read a little in Gibbon.3 F.] Rose 1/2 past 6, the weather very cold, wind blowing from N.W. with much force . The houses and trees are covered with ice.  As I went to open the Academy about 7 I noticed that loaded teams had crossed the green on the crust [illegible] as to incommode the horses or the running of the sleds.       Levi Howel Esqr. breakfasted with us.  He is from Sussex with a load of flour: he brought it on a sled, and says the snow is so deep in his neighborhood that it is difficult passing.       TAUGHT. After school the Farce was rehearsed. Evening, I read in Mr. Whelpley's Compend, from Brennius to Commodus.4 S.] Taught in the forenoon.  In the afternoon we rehearsed at the Academy both the plays.

MulfordEvergreen			Lewis PhoenixBob Handy			P.M. WhelpleyHenry				Ogden HoffmanMorrington			Israel RussellGerald				Edward LaurenceDame Ashfield		Elias L.

To which was added a premium for writing, awarded to Hendricks Parse.	The plays were again performed at evening, before a crowded and refined audience.

At evening I went again to the theatre where I saw the plays The Siege of Belgrade & The Wags of Windsor.

Read some in my Blackstone lesson for Thursday, and finished the first Vol. of Gibbon.	If Gibbon is an Infidel, I must also call him a hypocrite.  It seems to me, there is little in his first volume which is manifestly against Christianity.  The two last chapters are expressly devoted to the Church; and he treats the subject with the most formal gravity.  A few witticisms of considerable latitude are to be found, but he is lavish in praising that peaceable gentle and harmless set of men, which the first emperors, either from motives of resentment or policy, have, in many instances, severely persecuted.  His greatest hostility, to Christianity, if he shews any at all, is discovered, in his raising objections apparently insurmountable, & leaving them entirely undemolished and commonly untouched.  An instance of this kind is found at the close of his first chapter on this subject where he mentions the supernatural darkness of the passion.28 T.] Rode in the morning from 5 till half past 6.       Taught. Evening read 2d Gibbon taken from Lib'y. last evening.29 W.] Taught.  Not very well.30. T.] Taught. At evening I recited Blackstone from Nusance to Orig.. Writ.1807 May1 F.] Taught.

I trained in Captn.. Rogers' company.6 W.] Taught school.  Evening read the 5th Chap. of Luke in greek, which is very hard for me to construe, having paid little attention to that language since I entered College in Oct. 1804.7 T.] Taught.

One in the Greek testament; four in Horace; one in Virgil; five in Nepos; seven in Eutropius; five in Cordin; and five who have not yet committed the grammar: besides a class of ten, not in the languages, five of them ladies, studying Morse's geography, large edition.  My 28 scholars in the languages @ 5 dollars bring me 140 Dolls. pr. quarter; the 10 @ 3-1/2 are 35, and I draw about 20 Dolls. from the other room after paying my assistant, making in the whole an income of about 195 Dolls. pr. quarter, $780 pr. Ann.  My board is 2 Dolls. p. week, clothing and pocket money about the rate of $150 per Ann. leaving on a rough calculation about 480 Dollars per annum my neat income.       In the evening Mr. Russell being absent our recitation was not made, and I gave my lesson another reading.8 F.	} Taught.

What ever reasons Julian might have had for disclaiming Christianity on account of the abuses practiced in the reigns immediately preceeding; he certainly rested on a slender foundation when he undertook to re-establish the morals of his subjects on Paganism, and the worship of a plurality of Gods.19 T.] TAUGHT.

These lectures should be on Speaking and writing compositions; preparatory to which I would give some sketches on language.  The division of the whole subject which I propose to myself is this, to discourse I on the Origin and progress of language II The Utility of Language III Art of using it.31 Sunday] Went to meeting in the forenoon.

I appeared in my new uniform with the Rangers.  This afternoon was cold & wet, had a fire in my study (Canfield's office) daring the evening.2 T.] Was Informed by Mr. Isaac Canfield, before breakfast, that I was last night appointed to deliver an Oration the fourth of July.       Taught. - did net much to-day but think of my appointment.  I am always pleased with distinction, but am doubtful in this instance the honor bestowed on me will not expose my ignorance to shame.3 W.] Taught.  To-day determined to write an Oration.  Began to think of the plan.  Concluded to write on the Blessings and the dangers of our country.4 T.] Taught.  Finished a Scheme for my Oration, and began to make a full draft.5 F.] Taught.

Tooke accused every other grammarian of more or less ignorance; some he thinks below his notice.  His theory seems plausible, and he does not leave it without many things alleged in all its parts for its support.  Harris & Lowth he certainly shews ignorant or inconsistant in the parts of them which he quotes: I cannot say how they would compare with him, when their whole system is taken into view.  Tooke's theory is to derive all conjunctions, prepositions and adverbs from verbs. 29 M.] Rose at 6, and at 7 rode round Mr. Ford's woods.- look'd at my geography.

I spent this evening in arranging this information in my oration, in that part where I had before spoken of British insults.2 T.] Taught. Studied my oration and made some slight alterations.3 F.] Taught, in the forenoon.  In the afternoon I studied my oration rehearsed it twice once in the store, and once at the Academy on the stage in presence of Chas. Russell as I had done twice before this week, in presence of Cruttenden and Chas. Estey.  Towards evening I assisted in putting up a stage in the meeting house.  This stage, which was twelve feet long and 8 wide, was erected in front of the pulpit, about 6 Inches longer than the top of the communion board.  Evening rehearsed my oration.4 S.] INDEPENDENCE.

Asa Hillyard.       After service, the procession formed at the church door, and march'd back to Coes, in the order in which they came.

Carmichael com. of arrangements, were drank to the firing of a field piece.  Several volunteers were afterwards drunk.  I was call'd upon and gave this:- An exclusive enjoyment of our own rights: self gov't. and self defence.-       About 5 I went on the mountain with a party of ladies and gentlemen, when we got our sins washed with a shower.  I went to bed about 8 o'clock, decently fatigued.5 Sunday] Rode to Mr. Meeker's before breakfast.  Went to meeting.  Read a chapter in Gibbon's 3d volume.6 M.	} Rode every morning.

The reason of the order is the late lawless conduct of the British squadron in the Chesapeake.       In the afternoon I read a chapter in Gibbon, and began III Blackstone.12 Sunday] I went to Dover, Dr. Abm., Dr. Pierson, & John Lacey, returned before sundown. -- rumored that the British have bombarded Norfolk.13 M.] Rose at 6 and entered Canfield & Wood's account this day rendered.

To-day was Mr. Whelpley's examination.16 T.] EXAMINATION.  Finished examining about 1 o'clock, and in the afternoon collected $90 for tuition.17 F.] In the morning I spent about two hours posting my books.  After that I wrote a letter to Wm. A. Whelpley, giving him an account of the celebration of the 4, of my school, Mr. Whelpley's, and of the girls.  At 11 I went to Stevenson's examination.  In his school may be found some science more impudence and much disorder.       Afternoon 2 read a chapter in Gibbon - carried my letter to Whelpley, to the post office, and prepared for going to N.Y. toomorrow.       Spent the evening in walking, and at Mrs. Wetmore's with Misses Bleeker, Hamilton, Russell & Pierson.18 S.] Rose 1/2 past 4 and prepared for N.

We returned thro' whore town, where Phil. shewed his dexterity at catching girls in the street.  R. Russell and I, as we ware returning through Broad Way, called at Mr. Lovell's, where we were introduced to Miss Sally Elmer.  (The first time I ever saw her).	We stayed about an hour, I, at the request of Mrs. Lovell, sang several songs, among which were 'Peggy Perkins,' 'Megan oh,' & 'Smile & a Tear'.  I lodged with Robt. in Water St.	Miss Elmer is about the middle size; has black or dark hair, grey eyes, & a short round nose; mouth rather large and lips not very thin.  She is a person of few words, but appears sensible: more grave than gay, but perhaps not too reserved for a Miss of 32.  The heart which is warmed only by the beams of personal beauty, might leave her presence without fluttering; but her good sense might enable a more philosophic beau, to with-stand the darts that are shot from her grey eyes, or disregard the bite which her embrowned teeth threaten the coxcomb. 19 Sunday] Rose at 6 and at 7 came to Lovell's to breakfast.  After breakfast, I spent an hour or two walking with my Morris friends.  Forenoon went to meeting in the old church in Wall St., and heard Dr. Kollock of Savannah.

Fenno is one of the eldest sons of Fenno of Philadelphia, Editor of the U.States Gazette, and who died several years ago of the yellow fever.  Charles is about 23 perhaps 25.  He has been 7 years at sea.  He now belongs to the British navy, and last spring received the appointment of a Lieutenancy, he is lately from the West Indies where he was stationed under Admir'l Cachran.  He has been six months out of health.  His family are consumptive and he in particular has injured his constitution by his exertions at sea.  He came to town for his health about 3 weeks ago; but being weak in body and subject to a depression of spirits, he gained very little benefit as he thought; and has therefore returned.  I think he will never get well.12 W.] Taught.  Read in Blackstone; and finished Gibbon's 4 vol.  Rec'd. a letter from Wm. A. Whelpley & stating his intention to spend a year or two in teaching school & that his brother James is preparing for College.13 T.] Taught.

In the afternoon I read in Gibbon concerning the worship of images in the Roman empire, and the history of Charlemagne.  About 6 I went to Mrs. Russell's.  Eliza E. Pierson and I went to Mr. Lewis'.  Came home about 9 and read in Caesar the next week's work of the Caesar class:- the conclusion of Caesar's first war with the Helvetii.16 Sunday] Went to meeting in the forenoon, did not feel well.  I read to-day some in Gibbon, and the whole of the Tragedy Othello.       Towards evening, I was called on by T. Gibbons Esqre. of Georgia, whose son William is one of the smartest and best boys in my school.  With Mr. Gibbons I walked down to Gen'l. Doughty's.  On the way, the conversation turning on lawyers, and I happening to mention Fitch, Mr. G. informed me that he knows him; that he is secretary to the governor, and is probably doing well.       In the evening, I went to Mr. Whelpley's to speak about a play, and consult Mr. W. respecting giving an invitation to Wm. his nephew to come and teach with me in the Academy: a thing I have had in view some days, since he informed me by letter he was willing to teach a year or two.       Before I came away, Mr. W, showed me a latter he had lately received from Wm.  It contained what I had little expected to see - that Wm. has lately turned his thoughts seriously to matters of religion.  He observes to his uncle that he has scruples on the subject of studying law,- thinks that altho' m a study may not be repugnant to "morality", the practice of it is usually apt to estrange the mind from "practical religion", and the great business of the "salvation of the soul".  From these expressions and several others as direct, if not more so, I conclude the letter is not an incorrect picture of the writer's mind; and that Wm. is really growing, if he has not already become, religious.  To deceive is not his practice; but that he should deceive an uncle, a man whom I know he esteems and has great reason to esteem,- that he should deceive him, and on so solemn a subject as that of his eternal salvation,- is utterly incredible.17 M.]  Morning read a lesson in Blackstone, Misprisions & Contempts.  Taught.  After school concluded to play Othello this fall: made a distribution of the parts.	Spent the evening at Russell's new office this side of his house, reciting in Blackstone.18 T.] Taught.19 W.]  Taught.  Concluded to play the part of Iago myself.20 T.] Taught.  Wrote a letter to Wm. Whelpley, offering him 2/5 of the neat revenue of the Academy if he would come and teach our English school, taking the Geography class in his room.21 F.] Taught.  Read Walker's essay on Greek & Latin, quantity & Accent; subjoined to his key to Classical pronunciation.	Walker thinks the ancients pronounced their words in poetic lines very different from what they did when standing alone.	For instance, Teétyre toó patuleé recubánes soob teegmine fagi, he thinks the true pronunciation of Virgil's first line.22 S.] Taught in the forenoon - Aftn. read Chapter of Monomet's [=Mohomet's?] life & actions in Gibbon.       To-day Cruttenden among others, was drafted from Rodger's company, for one of the malitia detachment of this state.23 Sunday] Went to meeting forenoon.24 M.	} Taught.  Was alarmed on Tuesday with the appearance in a small degree of spitting blood.  Relaxed in my studies.  Early in the week I rec'd. a letter from Fitch in Georgia stating that he is doing well and is coming to the North next season.  Saturday we had a partial rehearsal of Othello.25 T.	}26 W.	}27 T.	}28 F.	}29 S.	}30 Sunday] I went to meeting in the forenoon.  Henry Ford dined with me.  After dimmer I read the III & IV Satires of Horace I book.         At 3 o'clock Mr. Wood called for me and went to 19Veal town.  We returned thro. Basking ridge and reached Mr. Meeker's a little after sundown.  I came on foot to Dr. Campfield's.  Chas. Russell's and home.31 M.] Before breakfast did something to my part (Iago) in Othello.  Taught.  After school rehearsed the first act.1807 September1 T.] Rode before breakfast.       Taught.  Aft. school rehearsed the 2 act of Othello,2 W.] Taught. At ev'g. reh'd the 3 act of Othello.  I felt a pain in the breast, as I thot. arising from too much speaking.  We concluded to rehearse no more till Saturday.3 T.]  Taught.  This afternoon, pretty well sickened of our choice of Othello and feeling myself unable to perform the part of Iago, I proposed to Chas. Estey to look out for something more suitable.  We went to Mr. Pierson's and borrowed 2 vols. of her plays.  We read there the plays Duenna, The school of Arrogance & A house to be sold.  None suited.  We retired to rest after midnight.4 F.] Taught.  This evening Chas. Cruttenden & myself read in Clara's books The Gamester & John Bull.  The latter pleased but we could not persuade Cruttenden to take a part - he did not like any part in the whole play, for himself.  We were at it till 2 in the morning.5 S.] Taught in the forenoon.  Afternoon Cruttenden informed us that he had taken another look at Job Thornbury and thought better of it he would take it.  We therefore agreed to substitute John Bull in place of Othello, and for an entertainment play Love laughs at Locksmiths.  We made a distribution - went to the Academy and instead of rehearsing Othello made known the change.	This afternoon after D. Estey & I had set out for Major Kinney's for a walk, we were overtaken by many people of the town with information that Mrs. Canf. & Mrs. Losey were very much hurt by a fall at the Slitting- mill bridge.  The report as to their being hurt we found exaggerated.  But they fell from the abutment of the bridge, by the horse backing, about 8 feet, the chair & horse were considerably injured, the people only frightened.  Mrs. Canfield had two of her children in her arms.6 Sunday] Went to meeting in the forenoon.  Spent the evening at Dr. Pierson's with D.E. Estey.       In a note in the 4th Satire of 1 Book of Horace, it is stated that Pythagoras used to direct his pupils to consider at night what they had done through the day, and reflect whether they had done what they ought.  What then is my present days work?  I left my pillow about 7 - a very improper time for a person who has a reputation to acquire, a fortune to make!  But I have been disturbed the two nights past on business of some moment.  Till 1/2 past 8 my time was spent in dressing and breakfasting.  I then posted several accounts.  Posted accounts? What, on Sunday!  Yes, and after I had finished them went to Dr. Condit's to carry a farce to Cruttenden & found the Dr. at his.  The doctor is a member of the legislature, asks a blessing at his table & has the reputation of a moral man.  Would it not have shamed me had Mr. Richards seen me.  God saw us both!  I went to meeting, heard Mr .Richards preach a sermon from Revelation, on the love of Christ to the world; but from the time it was pronounced to the present, it has not been in all my thoughts.  Better I had thought of it.  This was sacrament day.  I turned my back on the sacrament!  So did many others; but even all my companions kept it not from my mind that Christ was despised by us.  From 12 till 2 was spent in conversation what was said I cannot recollect;- some anecdotes perhaps, trifling - vain - nothing.  After dinner I read in Caesar and Horace as much as my classes will read this week.  In Caesar 'twas information, what I never before read.  In Horace I learned that so great a man s Pythagoras thought his conduct ought to be examined.  At 5 I went with D. Estey to Dr. Campfield's & Dr. Pierson's.  The conversation was on Plays, politics & law; but all old.  That Twaits can raise a roar - that Burr is a bad man but cannot be convicted of treason, and that Stockton has risen by industry.  In short I have spent a day of God in the business of man, in light talk, worldly pursuits & little benefit.7 M.] Taught,- concluded to play Risk in Love laughs Lockmiths, sent for the music.8 T.] Taught.  Aft. school rehearsed a part of the farce.9 W.] Taught.  Rec'd. from Robt. Russell pr. Jason (stage driver) a copy of the Faroe and two songs - the Farm Yard & Unfortunate Miss Bailey.

At noon, Mr. Butler from Saundersville (Geor.) call'd again to see me.  He informs me Saund. does not contain more than 40 or 50 inhabitants.  That the soil is light & sandy, is low and considered unhealthy.  That Fitch has the most business of any lawyer in the county, that he rides into 5 or 6 counties - that his practice last year cleared him 1500 doll's., he owns 2 negro boys and a horse and carriage, and will come on to the north next January.       At evening we rehearsed the two last acts of the Comedy.22 W.] Rode.  Taught.  Ev'g. we rehearsed the Farce.23 T.] Rode. Taught.  Ev'g. rehearsed the Comedy, had some spectators.24 F.] Rode in the morning.       Taught.  After school, Mr. Whelpley informed me that he had proposed to the Directors of our Academy, that he should have exhibitions in the Academy once or twice a year.  He asked me my opinion of the thing.  After a little reflection I told him if I had anything to say on the subject I should raise some objections.  He seemed rather displeased that I should have objections, and wished to know what they were.  I did not think it prudent to tell my mind fully without more thought on the subject, and put him off as easily as I could.  We parted without definite explanation.       My objections are 1st  The inconvenience to our school.  To open the house to him whenever he wishes to rehearse and perform will often throw our school rooms into confusion & give us much trouble.  2d It will have a tendency to sink our institution.  If he has exhibitions, he will want none of our boys to play, except to support some inferior parts; hence our boys will lose many opportunities of speaking.  Or if we play as often as tho' he did not (which will be unnecessary so long as the profits of his exhibitions are given to our funds as he proposes) it will multiply plays too much, which at best are unpopular in schools of this kind.  If he has as many exhibitions as he pleases, his boys will never assist us, and as our scholars are far more transitory than his we can never make so good exhibitions as he.  3dly It will excite a clashing of interests. Plays sparingly and prudently conducted are a considerable appendage to the interests of this Academy.  If he is allowed to participate in the direction of this business, and makes the best exhibitions; the reputation of our institution will be thrown into his hands; and thus while we are getting the pitiful compensation of money from his exhibitions, we shall suffer the institution to dwindle & decay at the heart.       The Directors & our employers last spring found fault that Mr. Whelpley's boys shared so largely in the exhibition.  Til the present distribution, several of them are left out.  Whelpley is piqued, but the Directors do not know it, and he is laying a scheme for his own interest.  But a house divided against itself cannot stand.  His interest and that of our institution cannot in all points coincide.       Evening I wrote a letter to T. Fitch Esqr. to be sent next week by Mr. Butler.            25 S.] Taught forenoon.  Afternoon read my school studies for next week.26 Sunday] Spent some hours of the forenoon in conversing with S.D. Russell concerning Whelpley's proposition.  Aftn. went to. Bottlehill with Cruttenden, to carry my letter for Fitch to Mr. Butler.27 M.] Taught.  Rehearsed in the evening.

This evening we rehearsed a part of the comedy.2 F.] Taught.  Finished rehearsing both plays this evening.3 S.] Taught in the forenoon.  In the afternoon I finished making out my accounts for the present quarter; and find that after paying Charles Estey 15 dollars for assistance and Cruttenden 87, I have about 220 left.4 Sunday] This forenoon I walked with Mr. Antny Glen down to Mr. Wm. Jones' to see a young Spaniard from the Havannah who wishes to study English.       Afternoon went to meeting; and spent the evening at Mrs. Russell's.5 M.] No school.  Preparing for Exhibition to-night.  At night we performed "John Bull'' & "Love laughs at Locksmiths".  In the farce I performed the part of Risk and sung the songs, 'The farm yard' & 'Kitty Maggs', the patter in place of 'Miss Bailey'.  The audience was very good, and my songs brought considerable clapping.  The exhibition was ended about 12 o'clock.6 T.] Taught.  Preparing for Examination tomorrow.7 W.] Examination. The classes examined were, Introduction, L. Grammar, E.Gram. Cordin, Erasmus, Nepos, Caesar, Horace and Geography, in my room.  Among other spectators, were Mr. & Mrs. Gerard Rutgers, Mr. & Miss Gibbons, Mr. Gilchrist, Mr. Hammond, Mr. L. Ogden & several others from abroad;- gentlemen of the town as many as usual.       The boys did well except in Horace, which class did not do themselves honor.	This evening a Comet, which lately made its appearance, was two hours or more visible before it set, being about the 3d degree of Sagittarius.  It appears from observation last night and this evening to be going east, about 2 degrees in 24 hours.  The tail appears not more than 2 feet long.  The star itself yet is quite dim.8 T.] From 9 to one I spent at Mr. Whelpley's examination.  This evening we played again.9 F.] Spent most of the day in collecting accounts.10 S.] Spent the forenoon in collecting.  Aftn. & evening with the ladies.11 Sunday] Attended meeting and heard Mr. Hallock.  After meeting walked to Charles Russell's, and spent the evening at Mrs. Russell's.12 M.] Rose at 1/2 past 5.  Instead of going to N,York, prepared to go to Turkey.  At 1/2 past 8, after receiving the money for my accts. vs Dr. Campfield & Major Ford, I set out for Turkey, with Chas. Russell's sulkey and Wm. Beaches mare.  Went through the swamp, call'd at Isaac Beedles and rec'd. 1 Dollar I lent him in court time.  John Littell & Schureman not at home, I called at John's, staid to dinner, left then at 3.  Call'd at Dr. Elmer's and at Chatham where I rec'd. 88 cents from Jonathan Parsons for recording a Deed.  From Chatham I went to Dr. Darcy's where I met according to expectation a company from town.  We left them about 11 and reached town about 12, after which 1 spent half an hour preparing for N.York.  At 1/2 past 12 went to Haley's where Mr. Wood is waiting for me.13 T.] After staying an hour at Halsey's, I ret'd. went to bed and rose at 1/2 past 6.  Went to N.York in the Stage, R. Russell, H.P. Russell & Wm. Chapman on board.       We reached N.Y. about four.  I dined at Kents when I took lodgings and about 5 saw the funeral of Mr. Charles Fenno coming down Broad Way.  I attended it to Trinity Church.       Evening I retired early.14 W.] Spent the forenoon selecting some books for Premiums next spring and collecting some of my Accounts.  Dined with Mr. A. Glen in Greenwich street.  After dinner I went to Mr. O. Hoffman's, where I took tea, and from that place to the Theatre with two of the Hoffman's, Lindly and his brother.         The Mountaineers was played.  Mr. Cooper in Octavian.  Cooper played well. His part (and that only in my opinion) made the piece interesting.  This is the first time I ever saw Mr. Cooper.       Mr. Cooper is a man about 5 feet 10 or 11 inches high; extremely well shaped; has a sufficiency of flesh, but is by no means burdened with it.  He has light blue eyes and dark brown hair,- his face is of the long kind, but is not too thin.  His skin is tolerable fair.  In his performance he is full of action; uses every limb with grace, and expresses much by his eyes.  His gestures are weighty as well as elegant and highly explanatory of what he says.  One peculiar method of using his right hand attracted my attention.  It is this.  In a sentence of high strained expression, he raises it between the direction of his face and shoulder, and making the gesture off from him and somewhat elevated, ends the motion with a strong tremor of the hand and wrist.  The idea may seem visionary, but it is fact, that this gesture whenever he made it made it gave me the idea of a stream of lightening flashing across the heavens.       His articulation is so clear & slow, that the auditor hears not only the words but the power of every letter.  His elocution is not the high strain of an enthusiast nor the cool deliberation of a logician, nor yet the elevated level of some popular preachers; but he is up & down, and slow and fast, and loud & soft just as the subject requires.  In his highest strains, when he is very loud, his voice is still melodious.15 T.] Morning called on Lowndes Brown whom I saw last evening at the Theatre, a classmate in College and who lives at Charlestown.  Call'd on several of my employers during the forenoon.  Saw Doughty, another of my classmates, at the office of Keese in Wall St. where he is studying.       Dined at Mr. J. O. Hoffman's where I was introduced to Mr. Rodman and Washington Irving one of the writers in the present periodical work called Salmagundi.       Spent the evening reading the Comedy called The Road to Ruin which is to be performed to-morrow evening..16 F.] During the forenoon I completed my business at N.York.  Dined at Mr. Lovell's and at 2 went with Mr. W. Irving to visit the scenery in the Theatre.       In the Theatre we found Mr. Cooper and several others preparing for the performance to-night.  We went into all parts of the house.  The following is a short and general description of it.       The stage is 30 feet front & nearly 50 deep, clear.  The side scenes about five feet wide, the top wider.  The side scenes are hooked upon frames, that stand on rolers in the cellar, extending up thro' the floor of the stage, and are moved by persons below.  The top scenes hang on pulleys from the garret, and are raised or let down by persons in the upper part of the house.  Thunder, rain or wind are made by particular instruments which are kept aloft in the garret.  In order to have all the scenes move at the same time the prompter uses a whistle, and to let the scene-changers know what particular scene is wanted, the prompter has bells placed in different parts of the house, which are rung by handles at his place.  He therefore has nothing to do but ring the particular bell and he has a room, a street, a forest, wind, rain, or thunder.       On the right hand to one in the audience room, the stage and scenery extend to the side of the house.  On the left, on the same floor with the stage, are the prompters room, and the green room the place where performers stay during performance.  From the Green room the players are called by call-boys sent from the prompter.  Over the Green room, Prompter's room &c, in the second, &third stories are dressing rooms, three on a floor.  Over these is the ward[illegible].  Over the stage the whole house is occupied to the top with the scenery and its machinery.  Over the dome is the storehouse where the various instruments for representation are kept; such as pikes, swords, helmets, chariots, ships, flying horses, dragons, &c, &c.       The whole immense building, contrary to my expectation, I find is completely occupied by the necessary appendages and apparatus of this theatre's institution.       At evening I went to the play and saw the Road to Ruin, & the Pantomime of Capt'n, Cooke.  Cooper played Harry Dornton.18 Sunday] Read in Gibbon.  Spent the evening in the house.19 M.] Read in the morning.  Read the 53, 4, & 5 chapters of Vth Gibbon.20 T.] Read in Gibbon all day.  Evening took a supper of oystersat Coe's.21 W.] Rode in the morning.  Read and slept all day.22 T.] Read in VI Gibbon an account of the seven Crusades.23 F.] Read.24 S.] Attended at the Academy most of the day where two carpenters were altering our writing tables; taking away the drawers and turning and plaining the leaves.       At evening I called on Mr. Whelpley just returned from New England.  He informs me that William is determined to come to Morris & will be here next week.       About 8 I attended at Hopkins', a meeting of the inhabitants of this place, consulting whether they will apply to the legislature for a bank.  It was agreed to.25 Sunday] In the forenoon I read, in the afternoon heard Mr. Whelpiey preach.26 M.] Opened School with about 30 scholars.  Ev'g. read Gibbon.27 T.] Rode in the morning.       Taught.  To-day concluded to go to Mrs. Russell's to-morrow to board.  Read Gibbon.28 W.] Rode.

In the evening I read the 68th chapter of Gibbon's history; containing an account of the taking of Constantinople by Mohamet II the turkish Sultan.  In the subject of this chapter ungov'd. passion and superstition shew themselves.30 F.] Rode.  Taught.  At night read some in Gibbon, and took a whim all on the sudden that it would be a good plan in me to write a romance of my own life; for the practice in composition.31 S.] Rode in the morning.	Taught forenoon.  Afternoon read 10 sections of the II Book of Caesar, and at evening finished the 69th chapter of Gibbon.  Wrote in Charles.201807 November1 Sunday] Rose at 7 and took a walk in a severe snow squawl.  Read in Gibbon the most of the day.       This evening made a calculation of the present and probable future revenue of the Academy and concluded that if Whelpley comes to assist me as I expect, I will offer him $5 p week for the present quarters; and next year will offer him and Cruttenden the following terms: viz. To Cruttenden I will give one fourth part of the whole tuition money of the Academy, if that part should not exceed 300 dollars.  To Whelpley I will give two fifths of the remainder, if that part should not exceed $450; both to be paid in the choice of the accounts from their rooms respectively.	To-day I finished Gibbon's history of the Decline & Fall of the Roman Empire.  Gibbon is celebrated as a Deist and an elegant writer.  Of his dius an opinion is easily formed, though at the end of the first volume I thought otherwise. He everywhere inculcates the belief that, those who have been christians have generally acted foolishly, sometimes very unjustly; and is willing to blame christianity rather than the men.  When a thing admits of doubt, and then leaves nothing in its place; it is always pulling down but never rebuilds.	To form a correct idea of his style requires more consideration.  He says he labored twenty years to complete the work: I think he labored too much.  His style is highly finished, but hard to be understood.  He is familiar, but has not the easy plainness of Hume, he is lofty, without the swelling which is sometimes seen in Gillies.  His sentences are generally too long, but the words are themselves plain; and with a skill elegantly concealed, are so arranged as to sound full and harmonious.  The reader at first is captivated, but on laying down the book to reflect he finds but a faint impression of the subject he has been reading.  For some time I was much at a loss for the reason why I did not understand Gibbon as well Gillies & Hume: at last I came to this conclusion.  That Gibbon writes in what may be called an abstract style.  He deals much in qualities and epithets.  When he speaks of a man, it is commonly by some title or appellation rather than by his proper name, and things he mentions by the name of some property belonging to them, rather than by the name of the things themselves.  The connection of his sentences lies deep but is extremely close; and if the reader's attention is a moment diverted, on its return he finds himself transported into unknown regions where everything is new.       On the whole if the reader has a general impression of the subject beforehand, and is prepared to prop the shattered fabric of Christianity which he finds crumbling over his head, he will find in Gibbon the language of a philosopher; a subject treated with more erudition than it was ever treated with before; & a work which he will read with tolerable ease and lasting benefit.2 M.] Rode in the morning.         Taught.

Ogden seven of the number of Salmagundi.  After reading to the end.of the 11th chap. in Rob'n. this evening I read four numbers of this new and much talked of work.  Very little of this production has heretofore come within my notice.  As far as I went I read for the express purpose of forming an opinion; and I must say that I think the writer deserves no higher praise than to be called a polished blackguard. My opinion may change as I react more of the work.2 W.] Rode.  Taught.  Evening read to the death of Charles V. spent 2 hours at Whelpley's with William.  Read Retaliation, and a handsome song in the Spectator: &c.3 T.] Rode.  Taught.  At evening I read in and completed Robertson's Chas. V.       With this work I am highly pleased.  It contains much important matter.  The writer always appears to have an object before him, and his whole work is conducted with Charles for its leader.  In narration Rob'n. is simple and plain.  His political deductions are clear, and he does not presume too much on the information of his reader.  In style the writer appears to have been full of his subject, not of himself, like Gibbon.4 F.] Rode in the morning.       Taught.  At evening I carried to the Library the last vol. of Rob'n. took the first of Modern Europe by Russell, and spent the evening at Mr. Whelpley's in the society.            5 S.] Taught in the forenoon.
